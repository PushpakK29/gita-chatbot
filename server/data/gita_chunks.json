    "text": "Originally  I  wrote  Bhagavad-gétä  As  It  Is  in  the  form  in  which  it  is \r\npresented  now.  When  this  book  was  first  published,  the  original  manuscript \r\nwas, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and \r\nwithout     explanations       for   most    of   the    original    verses    of   the   Çrémad \r\nBhagavad-gétä.  In  all  of  my  other  books—Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  Çré  Éçopaniñad, \r\netc.—the  system  is  that  I  give  the  original  verse,  its  English  transliteration, \r\nword-for-word  Sanskrit-English  equivalents,  translations  and  purports.  This \r\nmakes   the   book   very   authentic   and   scholarly   and   makes   the   meaning \r\nself-evident.  I  was  not  very  happy,  therefore,  when  I  had  to  minimize  my \r\noriginal manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gétä As It Is \r\nconsiderably  increased,  I  was  requested  by  many  scholars  and  devotees  to \r\npresent the book in its original form. Thus the present attempt is to offer the \r\noriginal  manuscript  of  this  great  book  of  knowledge  with  full  paramparä \r\nexplanation  in  order  to  establish  the  Kåñëa  consciousness  movement  more \r\nsoundly and progressively. \r\n    Our  Kåñëa  consciousness  movement  is  genuine,  historically  authorized, \r\nnatural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is. It \r\nis   gradually   becoming   the   most   popular  movement  in  the  entire  world, \r\nespecially  amongst  the  younger  generation.  It  is  becoming  more  and  more \r\ninteresting   to   the   older   generation   also.   Older   gentlemen   are   becoming \r\ninterested,  so  much  so  that  the  fathers  and  grandfathers  of  my  disciples  are \r\nencouraging       us   by   becoming       life  members       of   our   great    society,    the \r\nInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers \r\nand mothers used to come to see me to  express their feelings of gratitude for \r\nmy  leading  the  Kåñëa  consciousness  movement  throughout  the  entire  world. \r\nSome of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have \r\nstarted  the  Kåñëa  consciousness  movement  in  America.

If  I  have  any  credit  in  this  connection,  it  does  not  belong  to  me \r\npersonally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Oà \r\nViñëupäda  Paramahaàsa  Parivräjakäcärya  108  Çré  Çrémad  Bhaktisiddhänta \r\nSarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja Prabhupäda. \r\n    If personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried to \r\npresent     Bhagavad-gétä      as   it   is,  without     any    adulteration.     Before     my \r\npresentation  of  Bhagavad-gétä  As  It  Is,  almost  all  the  English  editions  of \r\nBhagavad-gétä were introduced to  fulfill someone’s personal ambition. But our \r\nattempt, in presenting  Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, is to present the mission of the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Our business is to present the will of \r\nKåñëa, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or \r\nscientist, for they have very little knowledge of Kåñëa, despite all their other \r\nknowledge.  When  Kåñëa  says,  man-manä  bhava  mad-bhakto  mad-yäjé  mäà \r\nnamaskuru [Bg.  18.65], etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that \r\nKåñëa  and  His  inner  spirit  are  different.  Kåñëa  is  absolute,  and  there  is  no \r\ndifference  between  Kåñëa’s  name,  Kåñëa’s  form,  Kåñëa’s  qualities,  Kåñëa’s \r\npastimes, etc. This absolute position of Kåñëa is difficult to understand for any \r\nperson  who  is  not  a  devotee  of  Kåñëa  in  the  system  of  paramparä  (disciplic \r\nsuccession).  Generally  the  so-called  scholars,  politicians,  philosophers,  and \r\nsvämés, without perfect knowledge of Kåñëa, try to banish or kill Kåñëa when \r\nwriting  commentary  on  Bhagavad-gétä.  Such  unauthorized  commentary  upon \r\nBhagavad-gétä is known as Mäyäväda-bhäñya, and Lord Caitanya has warned us \r\nabout  these  unauthorized  men.  Lord  Caitanya  clearly  says  that  anyone  who \r\ntries  to  understand  Bhagavad-gétä  from  the  Mäyävädé  point  of  view  will \r\ncommit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that the misguided \r\nstudent of  Bhagavad-gétä will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual \r\nguidance and will not be able to go back to home, back to Godhead. \r\n    Our only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in order to guide \r\nthe conditioned student to the same purpose for which Kåñëa descends to this \r\nplanet once in a day of Brahmä, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is \r\nstated in Bhagavad-gétä, and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no"

We  have  to  accept  this  fact  and thus understand the historical \r\nsignificance  of  Bhagavad-gétä,  without  misinterpretation,  on  the  authority  of \r\nKåñëa. To interpret Bhagavad-gétä without any reference to the will of Kåñëa is \r\nthe  greatest  offense.  In  order  to  save  oneself  from  this  offense,  one  has  to \r\nunderstand  the  Lord  as  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  as  He  was \r\ndirectly understood by Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa’s first disciple. Such understanding \r\nof  Bhagavad-gétä is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human \r\nsociety in fulfilling the mission of life. \r\n    The  Kåñëa  consciousness  movement  is  essential  in  human  society,  for  it \r\noffers  the  highest  perfection  of  life.  How  this  is  so  is  explained  fully  in  the \r\nBhagavad-gétä.  Unfortunately,  mundane  wranglers  have  taken  advantage  of \r\nBhagavad-gétä to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people \r\nregarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should \r\nknow  how  God,  or  Kåñëa,  is  great,  and  everyone  should  know  the  factual \r\nposition  of  the  living  entities.  Everyone  should  know  that  a  living  entity  is \r\neternally a servant and that unless one serves Kåñëa one has to serve illusion \r\nin different varieties of the three modes of material nature and thus wander \r\nperpetually  within  the  cycle  of  birth  and  death;  even  the  so-called  liberated \r\nMäyävädé speculator has to undergo this process. This knowledge constitutes a \r\ngreat  science,  and  each  and  every  living  being  has  to  hear  it  for  his  own \r\ninterest. \r\n    People  in  general,  especially  in  this  Age  of  Kali,  are  enamored  by  the \r\nexternal  energy  of  Kåñëa,  and  they  wrongly  think  that  by  advancement  of \r\nmaterial comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the \r\nmaterial  or  external  nature  is  very  strong, for everyone is strongly bound by \r\nthe stringent laws of material nature. A  living entity is happily the part and \r\nparcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service \r\nto  the  Lord.  By  the  spell  of  illusion  one  tries  to  be  happy  by  serving  his \r\npersonal  sense  gratification  in  different  forms  which  will  never  make  him \r\nhappy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy \r\nthe senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants"

Our  Kåñëa  consciousness  movement  is  teaching  the  whole \r\nworld  this  central  point,  and  because  we  are  not  polluting  the  theme  of \r\nBhagavad-gétä  As  It  Is,  anyone  seriously  interested  in  deriving  benefit  by \r\nstudying  the  Bhagavad-gétä  must  take  help  from  the  Kåñëa  consciousness \r\nmovement  for  practical  understanding  of  Bhagavad-gétä  under  the  direct \r\nguidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest \r\nbenefit by studying  Bhagavad-gétä As It Is as we have presented it here, and if \r\neven  one  man  becomes  a  pure  devotee  of  the  Lord,  we  shall  consider  our \r\nattempt a success."

Of \r\ncourse there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gétä, and one \r\nmay  question  the  necessity  for  another  one.  This  present  edition  can  be \r\nexplained  in  the  following  way.  Recently  an  American  lady  asked  me  to \r\nrecommend  an  English  translation  of  Bhagavad-gétä.  Of  course  in  America \r\nthere are so many editions of Bhagavad-gétä available in English, but as far as I \r\nhave seen, not only in America but also  in India, none of them can be strictly \r\nsaid to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator \r\nhas expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gétä as \r\nit is. \r\n    The  spirit  of  Bhagavad-gétä  is  mentioned  in  Bhagavad-gétä  itself.  It  is  just \r\nlike this: If we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the \r\ndirections written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our \r\nown  whim  or  the  direction  of  a  friend.  It  must  be  taken  according  to  the \r\ndirections  on  the  label  or  the  directions  given  by  a  physician.  Similarly, \r\nBhagavad-gétä  should  be  taken  or  accepted  as  it  is  directed  by  the  speaker \r\nHimself. The speaker of  Bhagavad-gétä is Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is mentioned on"

The  Lord  Himself  also  establishes \r\nHimself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gétä, and He \r\nis accepted as such in the  Brahma-saàhitä and all the  Puräëas, especially the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam,  known  as  the  Bhägavata  Puräëa  (kåñëas  tu  bhagavän \r\nsvayam).

But  in  the \r\ncourse of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, \r\nthis time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. \r\n    He  tells  Arjuna  that  He  is  relating  this  supreme  secret  to  him  because \r\nArjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä \r\nis a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are \r\nthree classes of transcendentalists, namely the jïäné, the  yogé and the  bhakta, \r\nor the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells \r\nArjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparä (disciplic \r\nsuccession)  because  the  old  succession  was  broken.  It  was  the  Lord’s  wish, \r\ntherefore, to establish another paramparä in the same line of thought that was \r\ncoming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching \r\nbe distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in \r\nunderstanding the Bhagavad-gétä. So we see that  Bhagavad-gétä is instructed to \r\nArjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student \r\nof Kåñëa, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gétä is best understood \r\nby a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a \r\ndevotee  in  a  direct  relationship  with  the  Lord.  As  soon  as  one  becomes  a \r\ndevotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a \r\nvery elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a \r\nrelationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different \r\nways:"

Paraà  dhäma  means  that  He  is  the \r\nsupreme rest or abode of everything; pavitram means that He is pure, untainted \r\nby  material  contamination;  puruñam  means  that  He  is  the  supreme  enjoyer; \r\nçäçvatam, original; divyam, transcendental; ädi-devam, the Supreme Personality \r\nof Godhead; ajam, the unborn; and vibhum, the greatest. \r\n    Now one may think that because Kåñëa was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna \r\nwas telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this \r\nkind  of  doubt  from  the  minds  of  the  readers  of  Bhagavad-gétä,  substantiates \r\nthese  praises  in  the  next  verse  when  he  says  that  Kåñëa  is  accepted  as  the \r\nSupreme  Personality  of  Godhead  not  only  by  himself  but  by  authorities  like \r\nNärada,  Asita,  Devala  and  Vyäsadeva.  These  are  great  personalities  who \r\ndistribute  the  Vedic  knowledge  as  it  is  accepted  by  all  äcäryas.  Therefore \r\nArjuna tells Kåñëa that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect. \r\nSarvam etad åtaà manye: “I accept everything You say to be true.” Arjuna also \r\nsays that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He \r\ncannot  be  known  even  by  the  great  demigods.  This  means  that  the  Lord \r\ncannot  even  be  known  by  personalities  greater  than  human  beings.  So  how \r\ncan a human being understand Lord Çré Kåñëa without becoming His devotee? \r\n    Therefore  Bhagavad-gétä  should  be  taken  up  in  a  spirit  of  devotion.  One \r\nshould not think that he is equal to Kåñëa, nor should he think that Kåñëa is \r\nan ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the \r\nSupreme      Personality      of  Godhead.       So   according     to   the    statements     of \r\nBhagavad-gétä  or  the  statements  of  Arjuna,  the  person  who  is  trying  to \r\nunderstand the Bhagavad-gétä, we should at least theoretically accept Çré Kåñëa \r\nas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with that submissive spirit we can \r\nunderstand   the   Bhagavad-gétä.   Unless   one   reads   the   Bhagavad-gétä   in   a \r\nsubmissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand Bhagavad-gétä, because it is a \r\ngreat mystery. \r\n    Just what is the  Bhagavad-gétä? The purpose of  Bhagavad-gétä is to deliver \r\nmankind from the nescience of material  existence. Every man is in difficulty \r\nin so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle"

Arjuna  surrendered  unto  Çré  Kåñëa,  and  consequently  this \r\nBhagavad-gétä  was  spoken.  Not  only  Arjuna,  but  every  one  of  us  is  full  of \r\nanxieties  because  of  this  material  existence.  Our  very  existence  is  in  the \r\natmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by \r\nnonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into \r\nasat. Asat refers to that which does not exist. \r\n    Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are \r\nactually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put \r\ninto this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position \r\nof questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering \r\nbut  rather  wants  to  make  a  solution  to  all  suffering,  then  one  is  not  to  be \r\nconsidered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry \r\nis awakened in one’s mind. In the  Brahma-sütra this  inquiry is called  brahma \r\njijïäsä.  Athäto  brahma  jijïäsä.  Every  activity  of  the  human  being  is  to  be \r\nconsidered  a  failure  unless  he  inquires  about  the  nature  of  the  Absolute. \r\nTherefore those who begin to question  why they are suffering or where they \r\ncame  from  and  where  they  shall  go  after  death  are  proper  students  for \r\nunderstanding  Bhagavad-gétä.  The  sincere  student  should  also  have  a  firm \r\nrespect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna. \r\n    Lord Kåñëa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when \r\nman forgets that purpose. Even then,  out of many, many human beings who \r\nawaken, there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his \r\nposition,  and  for  him  this   Bhagavad-gétä  is  spoken.  Actually  we  are  all \r\nswallowed by the tigress of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living \r\nentities,  especially  human  beings.  To  this  end  He  spoke  the  Bhagavad-gétä, \r\nmaking His friend Arjuna His student. \r\n    Being  an  associate  of  Lord  Kåñëa,  Arjuna  was  above  all  ignorance,  but \r\nArjuna  was  put  into  ignorance  on  the  Battlefield  of  Kurukñetra  just  to \r\nquestion Lord Kåñëa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain \r\nthem for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the \r\nplan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human \r\nlife. \r\n    The  subject  of  the  Bhagavad-gétä  entails  the  comprehension  of  five  basic"

First of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional \r\nposition   of   the   living   entities,  jévas.   There   is   éçvara,   which   means   the \r\ncontroller,  and  there  are  jévas,  the  living  entities  which  are  controlled.  If  a \r\nliving entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane. \r\nThe living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life. \r\nSo in the  Bhagavad-gétä the subject  matter deals with the  éçvara, the supreme \r\ncontroller,  and  the  jévas,  the  controlled  living  entities.  Prakåti  (material \r\nnature)  and  time  (the  duration  of  existence  of  the  whole  universe  or  the \r\nmanifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed. The \r\ncosmic  manifestation  is  full  of  different  activities.  All  living  entities  are \r\nengaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä we must learn what God is, \r\nwhat the living entities are, what prakåti is, what the cosmic manifestation is, \r\nhow it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are. \r\n    Out of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä it is established that \r\nthe  Supreme  Godhead,  or  Kåñëa,  or  Brahman,  or  the  supreme  controller,  or \r\nParamätmä—you may use whatever name you like—is the greatest of all. The \r\nliving beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord \r\nhas control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in \r\nthe later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä. Material nature is not independent. She is \r\nacting   under   the   directions   of   the   Supreme  Lord.  As  Lord  Kåñëa  says, \r\nmayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram: “This material nature is working \r\nunder My direction.” When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic \r\nnature,  we  should  know  that  behind  this  cosmic  manifestation  there  is  a \r\ncontroller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish \r\nnot  to  consider  the  controller.  For  instance,  a  child  may  think  that  an \r\nautomobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal \r\npulling  it,  but  a  sane  man  knows the nature of the automobile’s engineering \r\narrangement.  He  always  knows  that  behind  the  machinery  there  is  a  man,  a \r\ndriver.  Similarly,  the  Supreme  Lord  is  the  driver  under  whose  direction \r\neverything is working. Now the jévas, or the living entities, have been accepted \r\nby the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A \r\nparticle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and \r\nsimilarly   we   the   living   entities,   being   part   and   parcel   of   the   supreme"

We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control \r\nspace or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kåñëa. \r\nBut  although  we  have  a  tendency  to  lord  it  over  material  nature,  we  should \r\nknow     that    we   are    not   the    supreme     controller.     This    is  explained     in \r\nBhagavad-gétä. \r\n    What is material nature? This is also explained in  Gétä as inferior  prakåti, \r\ninferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prakåti. Prakåti is \r\nalways under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti is female, and she is \r\ncontrolled  by  the  Lord  just  as  the  activities  of  a  wife  are  controlled  by  the \r\nhusband.  Prakåti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the \r\npredominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated, \r\ncontrolled  by  the  Supreme  Lord.  According  to  the  Gétä,  the  living  entities, \r\nalthough parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakåti. \r\nThis is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Apareyam \r\nitas tv anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm/ jéva-bhütäm: “This material nature is \r\nMy inferior prakåti, but beyond this is another prakåti—jéva-bhütäm, the living \r\nentity.” \r\n    Material   nature   itself   is   constituted   by   three   qualities:   the   mode   of \r\ngoodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes \r\nthere is eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under \r\nthe control and purview of eternal time there are activities, which are called \r\nkarma.  These  activities  are  being  carried  out  from  time  immemorial,  and  we \r\nare suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am \r\na businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed \r\na great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my \r\nmoney  in  business;  then  I  am  a  sufferer.  Similarly,  in  every  field  of  life  we \r\nenjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma. \r\n    Éçvara  (the  Supreme  Lord), jéva  (the  living  entity),  prakåti  (nature),  käla \r\n(eternal time) and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. Out \r\nof these five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal. \r\nThe  manifestation  of  prakåti  may  be  temporary,  but  it  is  not  false.  Some"

The manifestation of the world is not accepted as \r\nfalse;  it  is  accepted  as  real,  but  temporary.  It  is  likened  unto  a  cloud  which \r\nmoves  across  the  sky,  or  the  coming  of  the  rainy  season,  which  nourishes \r\ngrains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, \r\nall the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material \r\nmanifestation  takes  place  at  a  certain  interval,  stays  for  a  while  and  then \r\ndisappears.   Such   are   the   workings   of  prakåti.   But   this   cycle   is   working \r\neternally. Therefore prakåti is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as \r\n“My  prakåti.”  This  material  nature  is  the  separated  energy  of  the  Supreme \r\nLord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, \r\nalthough they are not separated but eternally related. So the Lord, the living \r\nentity,  material  nature  and  time  are  all  interrelated  and  are  all  eternal. \r\nHowever, the other item,  karma, is not eternal. The effects of  karma may be \r\nvery old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from \r\ntime immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or our activity, \r\nand this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged \r\nin various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we \r\nshould adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities, \r\nbut this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. \r\n    The position of éçvara, the Supreme Lord, is that of supreme consciousness. \r\nThe jévas, or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, \r\nare also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as \r\nprakåti,  the  energy  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  but  one  of  the  two,  the  jéva,  is \r\nconscious. The other prakåti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore \r\nthe jéva-prakåti  is  called  superior  because  the  jéva  has  consciousness  which  is \r\nsimilar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supreme consciousness, however, and one \r\nshould  not  claim  that  the jéva,  the  living  entity,  is  also  supremely  conscious. \r\nThe living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection, \r\nand the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be, \r\nbut he is not perfectly or supremely conscious. \r\n    The  distinction  between  the  jéva  and  the  éçvara  will  be  explained  in  the"

The Lord is  kñetra-jïa, conscious, as is \r\nthe  living  being,  but  the  living  being  is  conscious  of  his  particular  body, \r\nwhereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of \r\nevery living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular \r\njévas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Paramätmä, the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone’s heart as éçvara, as the \r\ncontroller,  and  that  He  is  giving  directions  for  the  living  entity  to  act  as  he \r\ndesires.   The   living   entity   forgets   what   to   do.   First   of   all   he   makes   a \r\ndetermination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the actions \r\nand reactions of his own  karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters \r\nanother  type  of  body,  as  we  put  on  and  take  off  clothes.  As  the  soul  thus \r\nmigrates,  he  suffers  the  actions  and  reactions  of  his  past  activities.  These \r\nactivities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in \r\nsanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, \r\nthen  all  the  actions  and  reactions  of  his  past  activities  can  be  changed. \r\nConsequently, karma is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items \r\n(éçvara,  jéva,  prakåti,  time  and  karma)  four  are  eternal,  whereas  karma  is  not \r\neternal. \r\n    The supreme conscious éçvara is similar to the living entity in this way: both \r\nthe consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental. \r\nIt is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a \r\nmistaken      idea.   The     theory     that   consciousness       develops     under     certain \r\ncircumstances  of  material  combination  is  not  accepted  in  the  Bhagavad-gétä. \r\nConsciousness  may  be  pervertedly  reflected  by  the  covering  of  material \r\ncircumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a \r\ncertain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected. Lord \r\nKåñëa  says,  mayädhyakñeëa  prakåtiù  [Bg.  9.10].  When  He  descends  into  the \r\nmaterial universe, His consciousness is  not materially affected. If He were so \r\naffected, He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in \r\nthe  Bhagavad-gétä.  One  cannot  say  anything  about  the  transcendental  world \r\nwithout being free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is \r\nnot  materially  contaminated.  Our  consciousness,  at  the  present  moment, \r\nhowever,  is materially contaminated. The  Bhagavad-gétä teaches that we have"

In  pure  consciousness, \r\nour actions will be dovetailed to the will of éçvara, and that will make us happy. \r\nIt  is  not  that  we  have  to  cease  all  activities.  Rather,  our  activities  are  to  be \r\npurified, and purified activities are called bhakti. Activities in  bhakti appear to \r\nbe like ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person \r\nmay see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a \r\nperson with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the \r\ndevotee  or  of  the  Lord  are  not  contaminated  by  impure  consciousness  or \r\nmatter.  They  are  transcendental  to  the  three  modes  of  nature.  We  should \r\nknow, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated. \r\n    When  we  are  materially  contaminated,  we  are  called  conditioned.  False \r\nconsciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material \r\nnature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily \r\nconceptions  cannot  understand  his  situation.  Bhagavad-gétä  was  spoken  to \r\nliberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this \r\nposition in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become \r\nfree from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the \r\ntranscendentalist.  One  who  wants  to  become  free,  who  wants  to  become \r\nliberated,  must  first  of  all  learn  that  he  is  not  this  material  body.  Mukti,  or \r\nliberation,      means       freedom       from      material      consciousness.        In     the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam          also    the   definition      of   liberation     is  given.    Muktir \r\nhitvänyathä-rüpaà  svarüpeëa  vyavasthitiù:  mukti  means  liberation  from  the \r\ncontaminated  consciousness  of  this  material  world  and  situation  in  pure \r\nconsciousness.  All  the  instructions  of  Bhagavad-gétä  are  intended  to  awaken \r\nthis  pure  consciousness,  and  therefore  we  find  at  the  last  stage  of  the  Gétä’s \r\ninstructions  that  Kåñëa  is  asking  Arjuna  whether  he  is  now  in  purified \r\nconsciousness.  Purified  consciousness  means  acting  in  accordance  with  the \r\ninstructions  of  the  Lord.  This  is  the  whole  sum  and  substance  of  purified \r\nconsciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of \r\nthe  Lord,  but  for  us  there  is  the  affinity  of  being  affected  by  the  inferior \r\nmodes.  But  the  Lord,  being  the  Supreme,  is  never  affected.  That  is  the \r\ndifference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls. \r\n    What is this consciousness? This consciousness is “I am.” Then what am I?"

I am \r\nthe enjoyer.” The world revolves because  every living being thinks that he is \r\nthe  lord  and  creator  of  the  material  world.  Material  consciousness  has  two \r\npsychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the \r\nenjoyer.  But  actually  the  Supreme  Lord  is  both  the  creator  and  the  enjoyer, \r\nand the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the \r\ncreator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. \r\nFor instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of \r\nthe body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes, and so on are \r\nall parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the \r\nenjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of \r\nthe  body  are  engaged  in  satisfying  the  stomach  because  the  stomach  is  the \r\nprincipal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is \r\ngiven  to  the  stomach.  One  nourishes  the  tree  by  watering  its  root,  and  one \r\nnourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a \r\nhealthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. \r\nSimilarly,  the  Supreme  Lord  is  the  enjoyer  and  the  creator,  and  we,  as \r\nsubordinate   living   beings,   are   meant   to   cooperate   to   satisfy   Him.   This \r\ncooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all \r\nother parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take \r\nthe  food  themselves  instead  of  giving  it  to  the  stomach,  then  they  will  be \r\nfrustrated.  The  central  figure  of  creation  and  of  enjoyment  is  the  Supreme \r\nLord, and  the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The \r\nrelation  is  also  like  that  of  the  master and the servant. If the master is fully \r\nsatisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be \r\nsatisfied,  although  the  tendency  to  become  the  creator  and  the  tendency  to \r\nenjoy  the  material  world  are  there  also  in  the  living  entities  because  these \r\ntendencies  are  there  in  the  Supreme  Lord  who  has  created  the  manifested \r\ncosmic world. \r\n    We shall find, therefore, in this  Bhagavad-gétä that the complete whole is \r\ncomprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic \r\nmanifestation,  eternal  time  and  karma,  or  activities,  and  all  of  these  are \r\nexplained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete whole,"

The complete \r\nwhole  and  the  complete  Absolute  Truth  are  the  complete  Personality  of \r\nGodhead, Çré Kåñëa. All manifestations are due to His different energies. He is \r\nthe complete whole. \r\n    It is also explained in the Gétä that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate \r\nto the complete Supreme Person (brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham). Brahman is more \r\nexplicitly  explained  in  the  Brahma-sütra  to  be  like  the  rays  of  the  sunshine. \r\nThe  impersonal  Brahman  is  the  shining  rays  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, \r\nand so also is the conception of Paramätmä. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall \r\nbe seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruñottama, is above both \r\nimpersonal Brahman and the partial realization of Paramätmä. The Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead is called sac-cid-änanda-vigraha. The  Brahma-saàhitä \r\nbegins in this way: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/ anädir ädir \r\ngovindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam. “Govinda, Kåñëa, is the cause of all causes. He \r\nis the primal cause, and He is the very form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.” \r\nImpersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His sat (eternity) feature. \r\nParamätmä  realization  is  the  realization  of  sat-cit  (eternal  knowledge).

The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if \r\nHe is less than any other thing, then  He cannot be the complete whole. The \r\ncomplete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our \r\nexperience, otherwise it cannot be complete. \r\n    The  complete  whole,  Personality  of  Godhead,  has  immense  potencies \r\n(paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate ).

This phenomenal world or material world in \r\nwhich we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements \r\nof  which  this  material  universe  is  a  temporary  manifestation,  according  to \r\nSäìkhya  philosophy,  are  completely  adjusted  to  produce  complete  resources \r\nwhich  are  necessary  for  the  maintenance  and  subsistence  of  this  universe. \r\nThere is nothing extraneous, nor is there anything needed. This manifestation \r\nhas its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time \r\nis   complete,   these   temporary   manifestations   will   be   annihilated   by   the \r\ncomplete arrangement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small \r\ncomplete units, namely the living entities, to realize the complete, and all sorts \r\nof   incompleteness   are   experienced   due   to   incomplete   knowledge   of   the \r\ncomplete. So Bhagavad-gétä contains the complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom. \r\n    All Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be \r\ncomplete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and \r\naccording to småti, or Vedic injunction, if one  touches the stool of an animal \r\nhe has to take a bath to purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is \r\nconsidered      to   be   a  purifying     agent.    One     might    consider     this   to   be \r\ncontradictory, but it is accepted because it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by \r\naccepting this, one will not commit a mistake; subsequently it has been proved \r\nby modern science that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic \r\nknowledge  is  complete  because  it  is  above  all  doubts  and  mistakes,  and \r\nBhagavad-gétä is the essence of all Vedic knowledge. \r\n    Vedic  knowledge  is  not  a  question  of  research.  Our  research  work  is \r\nimperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to \r\naccept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in  Bhagavad-gétä, by \r\nthe paramparä (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the \r\nproper  source  in  disciplic  succession  beginning  with  the  supreme  spiritual \r\nmaster,  the  Lord  Himself,  and  handed  down  to  a  succession  of  spiritual \r\nmasters.  Arjuna,  the  student  who  took  lessons  from  Lord  Çré  Kåñëa,  accepts \r\neverything  that  He  says  without  contradicting  Him.  One  is  not  allowed  to \r\naccept  one  portion  of  Bhagavad-gétä  and  not  another.  No.  We  must  accept \r\nBhagavad-gétä  without  interpretation,  without  deletion  and  without  our  own \r\nwhimsical participation in the matter. The  Gétä should be taken as the most"

Vedic  knowledge  is  received  from \r\ntranscendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. \r\nThe  words  spoken  by  the  Lord  are  called  apauruñeya,  meaning  that  they  are \r\ndifferent from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected \r\nwith four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably \r\nillusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect \r\nsenses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information \r\nof all-pervading knowledge. \r\n    Vedic  knowledge  is  not  imparted  by  such  defective  living  entities.  It  was \r\nimparted unto the heart of Brahmä, the first created living being, and Brahmä \r\nin  his  turn  disseminated  this  knowledge  to  his  sons  and  disciples,  as  he \r\noriginally received it from the Lord. The Lord is pürëam, all-perfect, and there \r\nis no possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One \r\nshould  therefore  be  intelligent  enough  to  know  that  the  Lord  is  the  only \r\nproprietor  of  everything  in  the  universe  and  that  He  is  the  original  creator, \r\nthe  creator  of  Brahmä.  In  the  Eleventh  Chapter  the  Lord  is  addressed  as \r\nprapitämaha       [Bg.   11.39]  because     Brahmä      is   addressed     as   pitämaha,     the \r\ngrandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should claim \r\nto be the proprietor of anything; one should accept only things which are set \r\naside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance. \r\n    There are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which \r\nare set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä. In the \r\nbeginning,   Arjuna   decided   that   he   should   not   fight   in   the   Battle   of \r\nKurukñetra. This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not \r\npossible  for  him  to  enjoy  the  kingdom  after  killing  his  own  kinsmen.  This \r\ndecision  was  based  on  the  body  because  he  was  thinking  that  the  body  was \r\nhimself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers, nephews, \r\nbrothers-in-law,  grandfathers  and  so  on.  Therefore  he  wanted  to  satisfy  his \r\nbodily  demands.  Bhagavad-gétä  was  spoken  by  the  Lord  just  to  change  this \r\nview, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord \r\nwhen he says,  kariñye vacanaà tava [Bg.  18.73] : “I shall act according to Your \r\nword.” \r\n    In  this  world  men  are  not  meant  for  quarreling  like  cats  and  dogs.

A  human  being  should  realize  the  aim  of  his  life,  and \r\nthis  direction  is  given  in  all  Vedic  literatures,  and  the  essence  is  given  in \r\nBhagavad-gétä.  Vedic  literature  is  meant  for  human  beings,  not  for  animals. \r\nAnimals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their \r\npart, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, \r\nhe must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the  Bhagavad-gétä it \r\nis  clearly  explained  that  there  are  three  kinds  of  activities  according  to  the \r\ndifferent  modes  of  nature:  the  activities  of  goodness,  of  passion  and  of \r\nignorance.   Similarly,   there   are   three   kinds   of   eatables   also:   eatables   in \r\ngoodness,  passion  and  ignorance.  All  of  this  is  clearly  described,  and  if  we \r\nproperly  utilize  the  instructions  of  Bhagavad-gétä,  then  our  whole  life  will \r\nbecome purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which \r\nis beyond this material sky. [Bg. 15.6] \r\n    That destination is called the sanätana sky, the eternal, spiritual sky. In this \r\nmaterial world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays \r\nfor some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is \r\nthe law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a \r\npiece of fruit or anything. But beyond  this temporary world there is another \r\nworld of which we have information. That world consists of another nature, \r\nwhich is  sanätana, eternal. Jéva is also described as sanätana, eternal, and the \r\nLord  is  also  described  as  sanätana  in  the  Eleventh  Chapter.  We  have  an \r\nintimate  relationship  with  the  Lord,  and  because  we  are  all  qualitatively \r\none—the  sanätana-dhäma, or sky, the  sanätana Supreme Personality and the \r\nsanätana living entities—the whole purpose of  Bhagavad-gétä is to revive our \r\nsanätana occupation, or  sanätana-dharma, which is the eternal occupation of \r\nthe living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of \r\nthese activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities \r\nand take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is \r\ncalled our pure life. \r\n    The Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both sanätana, as are \r\nthe living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the \r\nliving entities in the sanätana abode is the perfection of human life.

Lord  Kåñëa \r\ndeclares  in  Bhagavad-gétä,  sarva-yoniñu.  ..  ahaà  béja-pradaù  pitä:  “I  am  the \r\nfather of all.” Of course there are all types of living entities according to their \r\nvarious  karmas, but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them. \r\nTherefore the Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls, to \r\ncall them back to the sanätana eternal sky so that the  sanätana living entities \r\nmay  regain  their  eternal  sanätana  positions  in  eternal  association  with  the \r\nLord.  The  Lord  comes  Himself  in  different  incarnations,  or  He  sends  His \r\nconfidential  servants  as  sons  or  His  associates  or  äcäryas  to  reclaim  the \r\nconditioned souls. \r\n    Therefore,  sanätana-dharma  does  not  refer  to  any  sectarian  process  of \r\nreligion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship \r\nwith the eternal Supreme Lord.  Sanätana-dharma refers, as stated previously, \r\nto  the  eternal  occupation  of  the  living  entity.  Çrépäda  Rämänujäcärya  has \r\nexplained the word sanätana as “that which has neither beginning nor end,” so \r\nwhen  we  speak  of  sanätana-dharma,  we  must  take  it  for  granted  on  the \r\nauthority of Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya that it has neither beginning nor end. \r\n    The  English  world  religion  is  a  little  different  from   sanätana-dharma. \r\nReligion conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith \r\nin a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but \r\nsanätana-dharma   refers   to   that   activity   which   cannot   be   changed.   For \r\ninstance,  liquidity  cannot  be  taken  from  water,  nor  can  heat  be  taken  from \r\nfire.  Similarly,  the  eternal  function  of  the  eternal  living  entity  cannot  be \r\ntaken  from  the  living  entity.  Sanätana-dharma  is  eternally  integral  with  the \r\nliving entity. When we speak of  sanätana-dharma, therefore, we must take it \r\nfor  granted  on  the  authority  of  Çrépäda  Rämänujäcärya  that  it  has  neither \r\nbeginning  nor  end.  That  which  has  neither  end  nor  beginning  must  not  be \r\nsectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some \r\nsectarian  faith  will  wrongly  consider  that  sanätana-dharma  is  also  sectarian, \r\nbut  if  we  go  deeply  into  the  matter  and  consider  it  in  the  light  of  modern \r\nscience, it is possible for us to see that  sanätana-dharma is the business of all \r\nthe people of the world—nay, of all the living entities of the universe. \r\n    Non-sanätana  religious  faith  may  have  some  beginning  in  the  annals  of"

Insofar  as  the  living \r\nentities are concerned, the authoritative çästras state that the living entity has \r\nneither birth nor death. In the  Gétä it is stated that the living entity is never \r\nborn and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to \r\nlive after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the \r\nconcept of sanätana-dharma, we must try to understand the concept of religion \r\nfrom the Sanskrit root meaning of the word.  Dharma refers to that which is \r\nconstantly  existing  with  a  particular  object.  We  conclude  that  there  is  heat \r\nand light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to \r\nthe word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being, \r\nthat  part  which  is  his  constant  companion.  That  constant  companion  is  his \r\neternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion. \r\n    When   Sanätana   Gosvämé   asked   Çré   Caitanya   Mahäprabhu   about   the \r\nsvarüpa     of   every    living   being,    the    Lord    replied    that   the    svarüpa,    or \r\nconstitutional  position,  of  the  living  being  is  the  rendering  of  service  to  the \r\nSupreme   Personality   of   Godhead.   If   we   analyze   this   statement   of   Lord \r\nCaitanya’s, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in \r\nrendering  service  to  another  living  being.  A  living  being  serves  other  living \r\nbeings  in  various  capacities.  By  doing  so,  the  living  entity  enjoys  life.  The \r\nlower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B \r\nmaster,  B  serves  C  master,  and  C  serves  D  master  and  so  on.  Under  these \r\ncircumstances,  we  can  see  that  one  friend serves another friend, the mother \r\nserves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so \r\non. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception \r\nin the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents \r\nhis manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The \r\nvoters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will \r\nrender  valuable  service  to  society.  The  shopkeeper  serves  the  customer,  and \r\nthe artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves the family, and the family \r\nserves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being. \r\nIn this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to \r\nother  living  beings,  and  therefore  we  can  safely  conclude  that  service  is  the"

Such  designations  are \r\nnon—sanätana-dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or \r\na Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change \r\nhis faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does \r\nnot affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, \r\nMuslim  or  Christian  in  all  circumstances  is  servant  of  someone.  Thus,  to \r\nprofess a particular type of faith is not to profess one’s sanätana-dharma. The \r\nrendering of service is sanätana-dharma. \r\n    Factually we are related to the Supreme Lord in service. The Supreme Lord \r\nis the supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created \r\nfor  His  enjoyment,  and  if  we  participate in that eternal enjoyment with the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy \r\notherwise. It is not possible to be happy independently, just as no one part of \r\nthe body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible \r\nfor  the  living  entity  to  be  happy  without  rendering  transcendental  loving \r\nservice unto the Supreme Lord. \r\n    In the Bhagavad-gétä, worship of different demigods or rendering service to \r\nthem is not approved.

When He manifests this form, there is no need for our imagining what \r\nHe  looks  like.

Unfortunately, the less intelligent \r\nderide Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being. \r\nBut  because  of  this  we  should  not  consider  the  Lord  one  of  us.

The  brahmajyoti  emanates  from  the  supreme  abode,  Kåñëaloka,  and \r\nthe änanda-maya, cin-maya planets, which are not material, float in those rays. \r\nThe  Lord  says,  na  tad  bhäsayate  süryo  na  çaçäìko  na  pävakaù/  yad  gatvä  na \r\nnivartante  tad  dhäma  paramaà  mama  [Bg.  15.6].

In  the \r\nmaterial  sky,  even  if  we  approach  the  highest  planet  (Brahmaloka),  what  to \r\nspeak  of  the  moon,  we  will  find  the  same  conditions  of  life,  namely  birth, \r\ndeath,  disease  and  old  age.  No  planet  in  the  material  universe  is  free  from \r\nthese four principles of material existence. \r\n    The living entities are traveling from  one planet to another, but it is not \r\nthat we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement. If \r\nwe desire to go to other planets, there is a process for going there. This is also \r\nmentioned:   yänti   deva-vratä   devän   pitèn   yänti   pitå-vratäù   [Bg.   9.25].   No \r\nmechanical  arrangement  is  necessary  if  we  want  interplanetary  travel.  The \r\nGétä instructs:  yänti deva-vratä devän. The moon, the sun and higher planets \r\nare  called  Svargaloka.  There  are  three  different  statuses  of  planets:  higher, \r\nmiddle and lower planetary systems. The earth belongs to the middle planetary \r\nsystem. Bhagavad-gétä informs us how to travel to the higher planetary systems \r\n(Devaloka) with a very simple formula: yänti deva-vratä devän.

    "text": "“Anyone  who  quits  his  body,  at  the  end  of  life,  remembering  Me,  attains \r\nimmediately to My nature; and there is no doubt of this.” [Bg.  8.5] One who \r\nthinks of Kåñëa at the time of his death goes to Kåñëa. One must remember the \r\nform of Kåñëa; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he surely approaches \r\nthe  spiritual  kingdom.  Mad-bhävam  refers  to  the  supreme  nature  of  the \r\nSupreme  Being.  The  Supreme  Being  is  sac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs.  5.1]—that \r\nis,  His  form  is  eternal,  full  of  knowledge  and  bliss.  Our  present  body  is  not \r\nsac-cid-änanda. It is  asat, not  sat. It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not  cit, \r\nfull  of  knowledge,  but  it  is  full  of  ignorance.  We  have  no  knowledge  of  the \r\nspiritual  kingdom,  nor  do  we  even  have  perfect  knowledge  of  this  material \r\nworld,  where  there  are  so  many  things  unknown  to  us.  The  body  is  also \r\nniränanda; instead of being full of bliss it is full of misery. All of the miseries \r\nwe experience in the material world  arise from the body, but one who leaves \r\nthis  body  thinking  of  Lord  Kåñëa,  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  at \r\nonce attains a sac-cid-änanda body. \r\n    The process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material \r\nworld is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body \r\nhe will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself, \r\nmake  this  decision.  According  to  our  activities  in  this  life,  we  either  rise  or \r\nsink. This life is a preparation for the next life. If we can prepare, therefore, in \r\nthis  life  to  get  promotion  to  the  kingdom of God, then surely, after quitting \r\nthis material body, we will attain a spiritual body just like the Lord’s. \r\n    As  explained  before,  there  are  different  kinds  of  transcendentalists—the \r\nbrahma-vädé,  paramätma-vädé  and  the  devotee—and,  as  mentioned,  in  the \r\nbrahmajyoti   (spiritual   sky)   there   are   innumerable   spiritual   planets.   The \r\nnumber  of  these  planets  is  far,  far  greater  than  all  of  the  planets  of  this"

This material world has been approximated as only one quarter \r\nof  the  creation  (ekäàçena  sthito  jagat).  In  this  material  segment  there  are \r\nmillions and billions of universes  with trillions of planets and suns, stars and \r\nmoons.  But  this  whole  material  creation  is  only  a  fragment  of  the  total \r\ncreation. Most of the creation is in the spiritual sky. One who desires to merge \r\ninto  the  existence  of  the  Supreme  Brahman  is  at  once  transferred  to  the \r\nbrahmajyoti  of  the  Supreme  Lord  and  thus  attains  the  spiritual  sky.  The \r\ndevotee,  who  wants  to  enjoy  the  association  of  the  Lord,  enters  into  the \r\nVaikuëöha  planets,  which  are  innumerable,  and  the  Supreme  Lord  by  His \r\nplenary expansions as Näräyaëa with four hands and with different names like \r\nPradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at \r\nthe  end  of  life  the  transcendentalists  think  either  of  the  brahmajyoti,  the \r\nParamätmä  or  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  Çré  Kåñëa.  In  all  cases  they \r\nenter  into  the  spiritual  sky,  but  only  the  devotee,  or  he  who  is  in  personal \r\ntouch  with  the  Supreme  Lord,  enters  into  the  Vaikuëöha  planets  or  the \r\nGoloka  Våndävana  planet.  The  Lord  further  adds  that  of  this  “there  is  no \r\ndoubt.” This must be believed firmly. We should not reject that which does not \r\ntally  with  our  imagination;  our  attitude  should  be  that  of  Arjuna:  “I  believe \r\neverything that You have said.” Therefore when the Lord says that at the time \r\nof   death   whoever   thinks   of   Him   as   Brahman   or   Paramätmä   or   as   the \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead  certainly  enters  into  the  spiritual  sky,  there  is  no \r\ndoubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it. \r\n    The Bhagavad-gétä  (8.6)  also  explains  the  general  principle  that  makes  it \r\npossible to enter the spiritual kingdom  simply by thinking of the Supreme at \r\nthe time of death:"

In \r\nthe  human  society,  whether  one  is  a  laborer,  merchant,  administrator  or \r\nfarmer,  or  even  if  one  belongs  to  the  highest  class  and  is  a  literary  man,  a \r\nscientist  or  a  theologian,  he  has  to  work  in  order  to  maintain  his  existence. \r\nThe Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but \r\nwhile  he  is  engaged  in  his  occupation  he  should  remember  Kåñëa  (mäm \r\nanusmara  [Bg.  8.7]).  If  he  doesn’t  practice  remembering  Kåñëa  while  he  is \r\nstruggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to remember Kåñëa \r\nat the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says, kértanéyaù sadä \r\nhariù:  [Cc.  adi  17.31]  one  should  practice  chanting  the  names  of  the  Lord \r\nalways. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord Kåñëa’s \r\ninstructions to Arjuna to “remember  Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to \r\n“always chant the names of Lord Kåñëa” are the same instruction. There is no \r\ndifference, because Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute \r\nstatus  there  is  no  difference  between  reference  and  referrent.  Therefore  we \r\nhave  to  practice  remembering  the  Lord  always,  twenty-four  hours  a  day,  by \r\nchanting His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can \r\nremember Him always. \r\n    How is this possible? The  äcäryas give the following example. If a married \r\nwoman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman \r\nother than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One \r\nwith such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is \r\nthinking  of  her  lover  is  always  thinking  of  meeting  him,  even  while  she  is \r\ncarrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work \r\neven more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, \r\nwe should always remember the supreme lover, Çré Kåñëa, and at the same time \r\nperform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. \r\nIf we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge \r\nour  duty  and  at  the  same  time  remember  Him.  But  we  have  to  develop  that \r\nsense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kåñëa; he was the \r\nconstant companion of Kåñëa, and at  the same time he was a warrior. Kåñëa \r\ndid not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When \r\nLord Kåñëa delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice"

All Rights Reserved. \r\n﻿    Bhagavad-gétä   is   the   widely   read   theistic   science   summarized   in   the \r\nGétä-mähätmya (Glorification of the Gétä). There it says that one should read \r\nBhagavad-gétä very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of \r\nÇré    Kåñëa     and    try    to   understand       it   without      personally     motivated \r\ninterpretations.      The     example     of   clear    understanding       is   there    in   the \r\nBhagavad-gétä  itself,  in  the  way  the  teaching  is  understood  by  Arjuna,  who \r\nheard  the  Gétä  directly  from  the  Lord.  If  someone  is  fortunate  enough  to \r\nunderstand       Bhagavad-gétä      in   that    line   of  disciplic    succession,     without \r\nmotivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all \r\nscriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gétä all that is contained \r\nin  other  scriptures,  but  the  reader  will  also  find  things  which  are  not  to  be \r\nfound  elsewhere.  That  is  the  specific  standard  of  the  Gétä.  It  is  the  perfect \r\ntheistic  science  because  it  is  directly  spoken  by  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa. \r\n    The  topics  discussed  by  Dhåtaräñöra  and  Saïjaya,  as  described  in  the \r\nMahäbhärata,   form   the   basic   principle   for   this   great   philosophy.   It   is \r\nunderstood  that  this  philosophy  evolved  on  the  Battlefield  of  Kurukñetra, \r\nwhich is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic \r\nage. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet \r\nfor the guidance of mankind. \r\n    The  word  dharma-kñetra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is \r\nsignificant because, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, the Supreme Personality \r\nof Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhåtaräñöra, the father of the \r\nKurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. In \r\nhis doubt, he inquired from his secretary Saïjaya, “What did they do?” He was \r\nconfident that both his sons and the  sons of his younger brother Päëòu were \r\nassembled in that Field of Kurukñetra for a determined engagement of the war. \r\nStill,  his  inquiry  is  significant.  He  did  not  want  a  compromise  between  the \r\ncousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the \r\nbattlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kurukñetra, which \r\nis  mentioned  elsewhere  in  the  Vedas  as  a  place  of  worship—even  for  the \r\ndenizens  of  heaven—Dhåtaräñöra  became very fearful about the influence of \r\nthe holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would"

Saïjaya was a student of Vyäsa, and therefore, by the mercy \r\nof Vyäsa, Saïjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kurukñetra even while \r\nhe was in the room of Dhåtaräñöra. And so, Dhåtaräñöra asked him about the \r\nsituation on the battlefield. \r\n    Both the Päëòavas and the sons of Dhåtaräñöra belong to the same family, \r\nbut  Dhåtaräñöra’s  mind  is  disclosed  herein.  He  deliberately  claimed  only  his \r\nsons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Päëòu from the family heritage. \r\nOne    can    thus   understand      the   specific   position   of   Dhåtaräñöra   in   his \r\nrelationship  with  his  nephews,  the  sons  of  Päëòu.  As  in  the  paddy  field  the \r\nunnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of \r\nthese  topics  that  in  the  religious  field  of  Kurukñetra,  where  the  father  of \r\nreligion,  Çré  Kåñëa,  was  present,  the  unwanted  plants  like  Dhåtaräñöra’s  son \r\nDuryodhana  and  others  would  be  wiped  out  and  the  thoroughly  religious \r\npersons, headed by Yudhiñöhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the \r\nsignificance  of  the  words  dharma-kñetre  and  kuru-kñetre,  apart  from  their \r\nhistorical and Vedic importance."

Here on the Battlefield \r\nof Kurukñetra the Lord directly controls  the transcendental senses of Arjuna, \r\nand  thus  His  particular  name  of  Håñékeça.  The  Lord  has  different  names \r\naccording to His different activities.  For example, His name is Madhusüdana \r\nbecause  He  killed  the  demon  of  the  name  Madhu;  His  name  is  Govinda \r\nbecause He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Väsudeva \r\nbecause  He  appeared  as  the  son  of  Vasudeva;  His  name  is  Devaké-nandana \r\nbecause  He  accepted  Devaké  as  His  mother;  His  name  is  Yaçodä-nandana \r\nbecause  He  awarded  His  childhood  pastimes  to  Yaçodä  at  Våndävana;  His \r\nname is Pärtha-särathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. \r\nSimilarly,  His  name  is  Håñékeça  because  He  gave  direction  to  Arjuna  on  the \r\nBattlefield of Kurukñetra. \r\n    Arjuna  is  referred  to  as  Dhanaïjaya  in  this  verse  because  he  helped  his \r\nelder  brother  in  fetching  wealth  when  it  was  required  by  the  king  to  make \r\nexpenditures  for  different  sacrifices.  Similarly,  Bhéma  is  known  as  Våkodara \r\nbecause he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such \r\nas killing the demon Hiòimba. So the  particular types of conchshell blown by \r\nthe  different  personalities  on  the  side  of  the  Päëòavas,  beginning  with  the \r\nLord’s,  were  all  very  encouraging  to  the  fighting  soldiers.  On  the  other  side \r\nthere  were  no  such  credits,  nor  the  presence  of  Lord  Kåñëa,  the  supreme \r\ndirector, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So they were predestined to lose \r\nthe  battle—and  that  was  the  message  announced  by  the  sounds  of  the \r\nconchshells."

So \r\nArjuna  conquered  both  sleep  and  ignorance  because  of  his  friendship  with \r\nKåñëa.  As  a  great  devotee  of  Kåñëa,  he  could  not  forget  Kåñëa  even  for  a \r\nmoment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a \r\ndevotee of the Lord can never be free  from thinking of Kåñëa’s name, form, \r\nqualities  and  pastimes.  Thus  a  devotee  of  Kåñëa  can  conquer  both  sleep  and \r\nignorance  simply  by  thinking  of  Kåñëa  constantly.  This  is  called  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, or samädhi. As Håñékeça, or the director of the senses and mind \r\nof every living entity, Kåñëa could understand Arjuna’s purpose in placing the \r\nchariot in the midst of the armies.

In such a blind conception of life, they forget even the causes \r\nof material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes \r\nfor a  kñatriya. It is said that two kinds of men, namely the  kñatriya who dies \r\ndirectly  in  front  of  the  battlefield  under  Kåñëa’s  personal  orders  and  the \r\nperson  in  the  renounced  order  of  life  who  is  absolutely  devoted  to  spiritual \r\nculture,  are  eligible  to  enter  into  the  sun  globe,  which  is  so  powerful  and \r\ndazzling.

Arjuna’s sole opportunity for gaining \r\na  kingdom  lies  in  fighting  with  his  cousins  and  brothers  and  reclaiming  the \r\nkingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do.

If we try to satisfy the senses of \r\nGovinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, \r\neveryone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier \r\nfor such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as \r\nmuch as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one \r\ntakes  the  opposite  way—namely,  when  one  tries  to  satisfy  the  senses  of \r\nGovinda  without  desiring  to  satisfy  one’s  own  senses—then  by  the  grace  of \r\nGovinda  all  desires  of  the  living  entity  are  satisfied.  Arjuna’s  deep  affection \r\nfor community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural \r\ncompassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to \r\nshow  his  opulence  to  friends  and  relatives,  but  Arjuna  fears  that  all  his \r\nrelatives and friends will be killed on the battlefield and he will be unable to \r\nshare his opulence after victory.

Since a devotee wants to satisfy \r\nthe desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for \r\nthe service of the Lord, and if the Lord  is not willing, he should not accept a \r\nfarthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need \r\nto kill them, he desired that Kåñëa kill  them personally. At this point he did \r\nnot  know  that  Kåñëa  had  already  killed  them  before  their  coming  into  the \r\nbattlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for Kåñëa. This fact \r\nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did \r\nnot like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the \r\nLord’s  plan  that  they  should  all  be  killed.  The  devotee  of  the  Lord  does  not \r\nretaliate  against  the  wrongdoer,  but  the  Lord  does  not  tolerate  any  mischief \r\ndone to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His \r\nown  account,  but  He  excuses  no  one  who  has  done  harm  to  His  devotees. \r\nTherefore  the  Lord  was  determined  to  kill  the  miscreants,  although  Arjuna \r\nwanted to excuse them."

Such aggressors are at once to be killed, \r\nand no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is \r\nquite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He \r\nwas  saintly  by  character,  and  therefore  he  wanted  to  deal  with  them  in \r\nsaintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kñatriya. Although a \r\nresponsible man in the administration of  a state is required to be saintly, he \r\nshould  not  be  cowardly.  For  example,  Lord  Räma  was  so  saintly  that  people \r\neven now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord Räma (räma-räjya), but \r\nLord  Räma  never  showed  any  cowardice.  Rävaëa  was  an  aggressor  against \r\nRäma because Rävaëa kidnapped Räma’s wife, Sétä, but Lord Räma gave him \r\nsufficient  lessons,  unparalleled  in  the  history  of  the  world.  In  Arjuna’s  case, \r\nhowever,  one  should  consider  the  special  type  of  aggressors,  namely  his  own \r\ngrandfather,  own  teacher,  friends,  sons,  grandsons,  etc.  Because  of  them, \r\nArjuna  thought  that  he  should  not  take  the  severe  steps  necessary  against \r\nordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such \r\ninjunctions   for   saintly   persons   are   more   important   than   any   political"

Arjuna  considered  that  rather  than  kill  his  own  kinsmen  for \r\npolitical reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and \r\nsaintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply \r\nfor   the   matter   of   temporary   bodily   happiness.   After   all,   kingdoms   and \r\npleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life \r\nand eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna’s addressing of Kåñëa \r\nas “Mädhava,” or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in \r\nthis  connection.  He  wanted  to  point  out  to  Kåñëa  that,  as  husband  of  the \r\ngoddess  of  fortune,  He  should  not  induce  Arjuna  to  take  up  a  matter  which \r\nwould   ultimately   bring   about   misfortune.   Kåñëa,   however,   never   brings \r\nmisfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees."

Such population depends on \r\nthe chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to \r\nbe  misled,  women  are  similarly  very  prone  to  degradation.  Therefore,  both \r\nchildren and women require protection by the elder members of the family.

According  to  Cäëakya  Paëòita,  women  are  generally  not  very \r\nintelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So the different family traditions of \r\nreligious  activities  should  always  engage  them,  and  thus  their  chastity  and \r\ndevotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the \r\nvarëäçrama system. On the failure of such  varëäçrama-dharma, naturally the \r\nwomen become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in \r\nat the risk of unwanted population.

The student \r\nwho has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to \r\nknowledge of the Paramätmä feature of  the Absolute Truth. And the student \r\nwho  can  enter  into  the  heart  of  the  sun  planet  is  compared  to  those  who \r\nrealize  the  personal  features  of  the  Supreme  Absolute  Truth.

The  sunshine,  the  sun  disc  and  the  inner  affairs  of  the  sun \r\nplanet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three \r\ndifferent phases are not in the same category. \r\n    The  Sanskrit  word  bhagavän  is  explained  by  the  great  authority  Paräçara \r\nMuni,  the  father  of  Vyäsadeva.

Persons  who  have  no  knowledge  of  liberation  from  material \r\nbondage  are  called  non-Äryans.

Such deviation from duty \r\ndoes not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the \r\nopportunity to become famous in this world.

In  every  step  there  is  perplexity,  and  therefore  it \r\nbehooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper \r\nguidance  for  executing  the  purpose  of  life.  All  Vedic  literatures  advise  us  to \r\napproach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, \r\nwhich  happen  without  our  desire.  They  are  like  a  forest  fire  that  somehow \r\nblazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such’ that \r\nperplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. \r\nNo one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic \r\nwisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to \r\nunderstand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master \r\nwho is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is \r\nsupposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material \r\nperplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this \r\nverse. \r\n    Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand \r\nthe  problems  of  life.  In  the Båhad-äraëyaka  Upaniñad  (3.8.10)  the  perplexed \r\nman is described as follows: yo vä etad akñaraà gärgy aviditväsmäû lokät praiti sa \r\nkåpaëaù.  “He  is  a  miserly  man  who  does  not  solve  the  problems  of  life  as  a \r\nhuman   and   who   thus   quits   this   world   like   the   cats   and   dogs,   without \r\nunderstanding  the  science  of  self-realization.”  This  human  form  of  life  is  a \r\nmost  valuable  asset  for  the  living  entity  who  can  utilize  it  for  solving  the \r\nproblems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly"

On the other hand, there is the brähmaëa, or he who is intelligent \r\nenough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life.  Ya etad akñaraà \r\ngärgi viditväsmäû lokät praiti sa brähmaëaù. \r\n    The    kåpaëas,   or   miserly   persons,   waste   their   time   in   being   overly \r\naffectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. \r\nOne  is  often  attached  to  family  life,  namely  to  wife,  children  and  other \r\nmembers, on the basis of “skin disease.” The  kåpaëa thinks that he is able to \r\nprotect his family members from death; or the kåpaëa thinks that his family or \r\nsociety can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be \r\nfound  even  in  the  lower  animals,  who  take  care  of  children  also.  Being \r\nintelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and \r\nhis  wish  to  protect  them  from  death  were  the  causes  of  his  perplexities. \r\nAlthough he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on \r\naccount of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore \r\nasking Lord Kåñëa, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. \r\nHe offers himself to Kåñëa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks \r\nbetween the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk \r\nvery  seriously  before  the  recognized  spiritual  master.  Kåñëa  is  therefore  the \r\noriginal spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gétä, and Arjuna is the first \r\ndisciple    for    understanding        the    Gétä.    How      Arjuna      understands       the \r\nBhagavad-gétä  is  stated  in  the  Gétä  itself.  And  yet  foolish  mundane  scholars \r\nexplain  that  one  need  not  submit  to  Kåñëa  as  a  person,  but  to  “the  unborn \r\nwithin  Kåñëa.”  There  is  no  difference  between  Kåñëa’s  within  and  without. \r\nAnd one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying \r\nto understand Bhagavad-gétä."

This indicated that he \r\nwould soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection \r\nand would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness,  and  would  then  surely  fight.  Thus  Dhåtaräñöra’s  joy  would  be \r\nfrustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by Kåñëa and would fight to the \r\nend."

As  Lord  of  all,  He  is  always  in  the \r\nsuperior  position  as  the  master  of  everyone,  and  yet  the  Lord  agrees  to  be  a \r\nfriend, a son, or a lover for a devotee who wants Him in such a role.

Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given \r\nmore   importance   than   politics   or   sociology,   but   he   did   not   know   that \r\nknowledge  of  matter,  soul  and  the  Supreme  is  even  more  important  than \r\nreligious formularies. And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should \r\nnot have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a \r\nvery  learned  man,  he  was  consequently  lamenting  for  something  which  was \r\nunworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished \r\ntoday or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul.

The  Lord  says  clearly  that  He  Himself,  Arjuna  and  all  the  kings \r\nwho are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that \r\nthe  Lord  is  eternally  the  maintainer  of  the individual living entities both in \r\ntheir conditioned and in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead  is  the  supreme  individual  person,  and  Arjuna,  the  Lord’s  eternal \r\nassociate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is \r\nnot that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will \r\nnot remain eternal persons. Their  individuality existed in the past, and their \r\nindividuality  will  continue  in  the  future  without  interruption.  Therefore, \r\nthere is no cause for lamentation for anyone. \r\n    The Mäyävädé theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by \r\nthe covering of mäyä, or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and \r\nlose  its  individual  existence  is  not  supported  herein  by  Lord  Kåñëa,  the \r\nsupreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the \r\nconditioned  state  supported  herein.  Kåñëa  clearly  says  herein  that  in  the \r\nfuture also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the \r\nUpaniñads, will continue eternally. This statement  of Kåñëa’s is authoritative \r\nbecause  Kåñëa  cannot  be  subject  to  illusion.  If  individuality  were  not  a  fact, \r\nthen  Kåñëa  would  not  have  stressed  it  so  much—even  for  the  future.  The \r\nMäyävädé may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kåñëa is not spiritual, \r\nbut material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, \r\nthen   how   can   one   distinguish   Kåñëa’s   individuality?   Kåñëa   affirms   His \r\nindividuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He \r\nhas  confirmed  His  individuality  in  many  ways,  and  impersonal  Brahman  has \r\nbeen  declared  to  be  subordinate  to  Him.  Kåñëa  has  maintained  spiritual \r\nindividuality  all  along;  if  He  is  accepted  as  an  ordinary  conditioned  soul  in \r\nindividual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gétä has no value as authoritative \r\nscripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable \r\nto  teach  that  which  is  worth  hearing.  The  Gétä  is  above  such  literature.  No"

When one accepts Kåñëa as \r\nan ordinary man, the Gétä loses all importance. The Mäyävädé argues that the \r\nplurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. \r\nBut  previous  to  this  verse  such  a  bodily  conception  is  already  condemned. \r\nAfter  condemning  the  bodily  conception  of  the  living  entities,  how  was  it \r\npossible  for  Kåñëa  to  place  a  conventional  proposition  on  the  body  again? \r\nTherefore,   individuality   is   maintained   on   spiritual   grounds   and   is   thus \r\nconfirmed   by   great   äcäryas   like   Çré   Rämänuja   and   others.   It   is   clearly \r\nmentioned  in  many  places  in  the  Gétä  that  this  spiritual  individuality  is \r\nunderstood by those who are devotees  of the Lord. Those who are envious of \r\nKåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the \r\ngreat  literature.  The  nondevotee’s  approach  to  the  teachings  of  the  Gétä  is \r\nsomething like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a \r\ntaste  of  honey  unless  one  opens  the  bottle.  Similarly,  the  mysticism  of  the \r\nBhagavad-gétä can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, \r\nas it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the  Gétä be touched \r\nby persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the Mäyävädé \r\nexplanation of the  Gétä is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. \r\nLord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the Mäyävädés \r\nand  warns  that  one  who  takes  to  such  an  understanding  of  the  Mäyävädé \r\nphilosophy  loses  all  power  to  understand  the  real  mystery  of  the  Gétä.  If \r\nindividuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching \r\nby the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal \r\nfact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned."

Yet  the  same  spirit  soul  is  there  and  does  not \r\nundergo  any  change.

Rather,  he  should  rejoice  for  their \r\nchanging bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such \r\nchanges of body account for varieties  of enjoyment or suffering, according to \r\none’s work in life. So Bhéñma and Droëa, being noble souls, were surely going \r\nto have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for \r\nsuperior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause \r\nof lamentation. \r\n    Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual \r\nsoul, the Supersoul, and nature—both material and spiritual—is called a dhéra, \r\nor a most sober man.

Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme \r\ncleavable  or  changeable,  against  the  principle  of  the  Supreme  Soul’s  being \r\nunchangeable.  As  confirmed  in  the  Gétä,  the  fragmental  portions  of  the \r\nSupreme exist eternally (sanätana) and are called kñara; that is, they have a \r\ntendency  to  fall  down  into  material  nature.  These  fragmental  portions  are \r\neternally   so,   and   even   after   liberation   the   individual   soul   remains   the \r\nsame—fragmental.  But  once  liberated,  he  lives  an  eternal  life  in  bliss  and \r\nknowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be \r\napplied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and \r\nis known as the Paramätmä. He is different from the individual living entity. \r\nWhen the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and \r\nthe moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities \r\nand  the  sun  or  the  moon  to  the  Supreme  Lord.  The  individual  fragmental \r\nspirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of \r\nGodhead Çré Kåñëa. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in \r\nthe  beginning  of  the  Fourth  Chapter.  If  Arjuna  is  on  the  same  level  with \r\nKåñëa,  and  Kåñëa  is  not  superior  to  Arjuna,  then  their  relationship  of \r\ninstructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by \r\nthe illusory energy (mäyä), then there is no need of one being the instructor \r\nand the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the \r\nclutches  of  mäyä,  no  one  can  be  an  authoritative  instructor.  Under  the \r\ncircumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, superior in \r\nposition to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by mäyä."

That  the  body  is  changing \r\nevery moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by \r\nmodern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the \r\nbody.  But  the  spirit  soul  exists  permanently,  remaining  the  same  despite  all \r\nchanges of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and \r\nspirit.  By  nature,  the  body  is  ever  changing,  and  the  soul  is  eternal.  This \r\nconclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist \r\nand personalist. In the Viñëu Puräëa (2.12.38) it is stated that Viñëu and His \r\nabodes  all  have  self-illuminated  spiritual  existence  (jyotéàñi  viñëur  bhuvanäni \r\nviñëuù).  The  words  existent  and  nonexistent  refer  only  to  spirit  and  matter. \r\nThat is the version of all seers of truth. \r\n    This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities \r\nwho  are  bewildered  by  the  influence  of  ignorance.  Removal  of  ignorance \r\ninvolves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper \r\nand  the  worshipable  and  the  consequent  understanding  of  the  difference \r\nbetween  the  part-and-parcel  living  entities  and  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study \r\nof oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood \r\nas the relationship between the part and the whole. In the  Vedänta-sütras, as \r\nwell  as  in  the  Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  the  Supreme  has  been  accepted  as  the \r\norigin  of  all  emanations.  Such  emanations  are  experienced  by  superior  and \r\ninferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as \r\nit  will  be  revealed  in  the  Seventh  Chapter.  Although  there  is  no  difference \r\nbetween  the  energy  and  the  energetic,  the  energetic  is  accepted  as  the \r\nSupreme,  and  energy  or  nature  is  accepted  as  the  subordinate.  The  living \r\nentities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case \r\nof  the  master  and  the  servant,  or  the  teacher  and  the  taught.

When the soul is purified from \r\nthe  contamination  of  the  five  kinds  of  material  air,  its  spiritual  influence  is \r\nexhibited.” \r\n    The  haöha-yoga  system  is  meant  for  controlling  the  five  kinds  of  air \r\nencircling  the  pure  soul  by  different  kinds  of  sitting  postures—not  for  any \r\nmaterial profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of \r\nthe material atmosphere. \r\n    So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, \r\nand it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only \r\nthe insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading viñëu-tattva. \r\n    The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. \r\nAccording to the Muëòaka Upaniñad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart \r\nof  every  living  entity,  and  because  the  measurement  of  the  atomic  soul  is \r\nbeyond  the  power  of  appreciation  of  the  material  scientists,  some  of  them \r\nassert foolishly that there is no soul.  The individual atomic soul is definitely \r\nthere in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily \r\nmovement  are  emanating  from  this  part  of  the  body.  The  corpuscles  which \r\ncarry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul \r\npasses  away  from  this  position,  the  activity  of  the  blood,  generating  fusion, \r\nceases.

Medical  science, \r\nhowever, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body. \r\n    Such  atomic  particles  of  the  spirit  whole  are  compared  to  the  sunshine \r\nmolecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, \r\nthe fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the \r\nSupreme Lord, called by the name prabhä, or superior energy.

Sometimes the soul \r\nis   called   the   steady,   or   küöa-stha.   The   body   is   subject   to   six   kinds   of \r\ntransformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother’s body, remains \r\nfor  some  time,  grows,  produces  some  effects,  gradually  dwindles,  and  at  last \r\nvanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. \r\nThe soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes \r\nits  birth.  The  soul  does  not  take  birth  there,  and  the  soul  does  not  die. \r\nAnything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, \r\nhe  therefore  has  no  past,  present  or  future.  He  is  eternal,  ever-existing,  and \r\nprimeval—that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being.

The so-called old man, \r\ntherefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. \r\nThe changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate \r\nlike  a  tree,  nor  anything  material.  The  soul  has  no  by-product  either.  The \r\nby-products  of  the  body,  namely  children,  are  also  different  individual  souls; \r\nand, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body \r\ndevelops because of the soul’s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor \r\nchange.

Therefore, \r\nconsciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul \r\nwithin the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of \r\nthe soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the \r\nsun in the sky owing to clouds, or for  some other reason, but the light of the \r\nsun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon \r\nas there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that \r\nthe  sun  is  in  the  sky.  Similarly,  since  there  is  some  consciousness  in  all \r\nbodies—whether man or animal—we can understand the presence of the soul. \r\nThis consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of \r\nthe   Supreme   because   the   supreme   consciousness   is   all-knowledge—past, \r\npresent  and  future.  The  consciousness  of  the  individual  soul  is  prone  to  be \r\nforgetful.

From  old  age,  the \r\nchange  is  transferred  to  another  body.  This  has  already  been  explained  in  a \r\nprevious verse (2.13). \r\n    Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible \r\nby the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic \r\nsoul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The  Vedas, like the  Muëòaka \r\nUpaniñad,  as  well  as  the  Çvetäçvatara  Upaniñad,  compare  the  soul  and  the \r\nSupersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the \r\nindividual  atomic  soul)  is  eating  the  fruit  of  the  tree,  and  the  other  bird \r\n(Kåñëa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds—although they are \r\nthe same in quality—one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while \r\nthe  other  is  simply  witnessing  the  activities  of  His  friend.  Kåñëa  is  the \r\nwitnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one \r\nis   still   the   master   and   the   other   is   the   servant.   Forgetfulness   of   this \r\nrelationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one’s changing his position from \r\none tree to another, or from one body to another.

And thus, hearing from Kåñëa, he \r\ncan understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation. \r\n    Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change \r\nof his old grandfather and his teacher.

As   far   as   the   soul’s   existence   is \r\nconcerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof \r\nof  çruti,  or  Vedic  wisdom.  We  have  to  accept  this  truth,  because  there  is  no \r\nother source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by \r\nperception.  There  are  many  things  we  have  to  accept  solely  on  grounds  of \r\nsuperior  authority.  No  one  can  deny  the  existence  of  his  father,  based  upon \r\nthe authority of his mother. There is no source of understanding the identity \r\nof  the  father  except  by  the  authority  of  the  mother.  Similarly,  there  is  no \r\nsource of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, \r\nthe  soul  is  inconceivable  by  human  experimental  knowledge.  The  soul  is \r\nconsciousness and conscious—that  also is the statement of the Vedas, and we \r\nhave to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. \r\nAs  eternally  unchangeable,  the  soul  remains  atomic  in  comparison  to  the \r\ninfinite  Supreme  Soul.  The  Supreme  Soul  is  infinite,  and  the  atomic  soul  is \r\ninfinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never \r\nbecome  equal  to  the  infinite  soul,  or  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead. \r\nThis  concept  is  repeated  in  the  Vedas  in  different  ways  just  to  confirm  the \r\nstability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in \r\norder that we understand the matter thoroughly, without error."

When Lord \r\nKåñëa spoke the  Bhagavad-gétä, it appears that such philosophers existed, and \r\nthey   were   known   as   the   lokäyatikas   and   vaibhäñikas.

The     modern     material    scientist    and   materialist \r\nphilosophers     also   think    similarly.  According      to   them,    the   body    is  a \r\ncombination  of  physical  elements,  and  at  a  certain  stage  the  life  symptoms \r\ndevelop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements.

On  the  other  hand,  in  modern  science  and  scientific \r\nwarfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the \r\nenemy.

And yoga involves controlling the senses. \r\nArjuna’s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his \r\nprime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing \r\nhis relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom \r\nafter  conquering  his  cousins  and  brothers,  the  sons  of  Dhåtaräñöra.  In  both \r\nways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from \r\nconquering them and happiness derived  by seeing kinsmen alive are both on \r\nthe basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. \r\nKåñëa, therefore, wanted to explain to  Arjuna that by killing the body of his \r\ngrandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all \r\nindividual  persons,  including  the  Lord  Himself,  are  eternal  individuals;  they \r\nwere individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will \r\ncontinue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual \r\nsouls  eternally.  We  simply  change  our  bodily dress in different manners, but \r\nactually  we  keep  our  individuality even after liberation from the bondage of \r\nmaterial  dress.  An  analytical  study  of  the  soul  and  the  body  has  been  very \r\ngraphically  explained  by  Lord  Kåñëa.  And  this  descriptive  knowledge  of  the \r\nsoul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as \r\nSäìkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This Säìkhya has nothing to do \r\nwith  Säìkhya  philosophy  of  the  atheist  Kapila.  Long  before  the  imposter \r\nKapila’s     Säìkhya,      the     Säìkhya      philosophy       was     expounded       in    the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  by  the  true  Lord  Kapila,  the  incarnation  of  Lord  Kåñëa, \r\nwho explained it to His mother, Devahüti. It is clearly explained by Him that \r\nthe puruña, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over \r\nthe prakåti. This is accepted in the  Vedas and in the  Gétä. The description in \r\nthe  Vedas  indicates  that  the  Lord  glanced  over  the  prakåti,  or  nature,  and \r\nimpregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working \r\nin  the  material  world  for  sense  gratification,  and  under  the  spell  of  material \r\nenergy  they  are  thinking  of  being  enjoyers.  This  mentality  is  dragged  to  the \r\nlast point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the \r\nLord.  This  is  the  last  snare  of  mäyä,  or  sense  gratificatory  illusion,  and  it  is \r\nonly after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great \r\nsoul surrenders unto Väsudeva, Lord Kåñëa, thereby fulfilling the search after"

Consequently, \r\nKåñëa   will   now   tell   him   about   the   working   process   in   buddhi-yoga,   or \r\nkarma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the \r\nsense  gratification  of  the  Lord.  This  buddhi-yoga  is  clearly  explained  in \r\nChapter  Ten,  verse  ten,  as  being  direct  communion  with  the  Lord,  who  is \r\nsitting as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart. But such communion does not take \r\nplace without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional \r\nor  transcendental  loving  service  to  the  Lord,  or,  in  other  words,  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, attains to this stage of  buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the \r\nLord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in \r\ndevotional   service   out   of   transcendental   love   does   He   award   the   pure \r\nknowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily \r\nin the ever-blissful kingdom of God. \r\n    Thus the  buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of \r\nthe Lord, and the word Säìkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the \r\natheistic  säìkhya-yoga  enunciated  by  the  imposter  Kapila.  One  should  not, \r\ntherefore,  misunderstand  that  the  säìkhya-yoga  mentioned  herein  has  any \r\nconnection  with  the  atheistic  Säìkhya.  Nor  did  that  philosophy  have  any \r\ninfluence during that time; nor would Lord Kåñëa care to mention such godless \r\nphilosophical  speculations.  Real  Säìkhya  philosophy  is  described  by  Lord \r\nKapila  in  the  Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  but  even  that  Säìkhya  has  nothing  to  do \r\nwith  the  current  topics.  Here,  Säìkhya  means  analytical  description  of  the \r\nbody and the soul. Lord Kåñëa made an  analytical description of the soul just \r\nto  bring  Arjuna  to  the  point  of  buddhi-yoga,  or  bhakti-yoga.  Therefore,  Lord \r\nKåñëa’s Säìkhya and Lord Kapila’s Säìkhya, as described in the  Bhägavatam, \r\nare  one  and  the  same.  They  are  all  bhakti-yoga.  Lord  Kåñëa  Said,  therefore, \r\nthat   only   the   less   intelligent   class   of   men   make   a   distinction   between \r\nsäìkhya-yoga   and   bhakti-yoga   (säìkhya-yogau   påthag   bäläù   pravadanti   na \r\npaëòitäù ). \r\n    Of  course,  atheistic  säìkhya-yoga  has  nothing  to  do  with  bhakti-yoga,  yet \r\nthe  unintelligent  claim  that  the  atheistic  säìkhya-yoga  is  referred  to  in  the"

One who \r\nworks for the satisfaction of the Lord  only, however difficult such work may \r\nbe, is working under the principles of  buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in \r\ntranscendental  bliss.  By  such  transcendental  engagement,  one  achieves  all \r\ntranscendental  understanding  automatically,  by  the  grace  of  the  Lord,  and \r\nthus  his  liberation  is  complete  in  itself,  without  his  making  extraneous \r\nendeavors  to  acquire  knowledge.  There  is  much  difference  between  work  in \r\nKåñëa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of \r\nsense   gratification   for   achieving   results   in   terms   of   family   or   material \r\nhappiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that \r\nwe perform."

When one is engaged \r\nin  the  duties  of  Kåñëa  consciousness,  he  need  not  act  in  relationship  to  the \r\nmaterial world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality. \r\nFruitive activities are the engagements of one’s reactions from past good or bad \r\ndeeds. When one is awake in Kåñëa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor \r\nfor good results in his activities. When one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, \r\nall  activities  are  on  the  absolute  plane,  for  they  are  no  longer  subject  to \r\ndualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Kåñëa consciousness is \r\nrenunciation  of  the  material  conception  of  life.  This  state  is  automatically \r\nachieved by progressive Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    The  resolute  purpose  of  a  person  in  Kåñëa  consciousness  is  based  on \r\nknowledge.  Väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù: a person in Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness  is  the  rare  good  soul  who  knows  perfectly  that  Väsudeva,  or \r\nKåñëa, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree \r\none automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in \r\nKåñëa consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone—namely \r\nself,  family,  society,  country,  humanity,  etc.  If  Kåñëa  is  satisfied  by  one’s \r\nactions, then everyone will be satisfied. \r\n    Service  in  Kåñëa  consciousness  is,  however,  best  practiced  under  the  able \r\nguidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kåñëa, who \r\nknows  the  nature  of  the  student  and  who  can  guide  him  to  act  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness. As such, to be well versed in Kåñëa consciousness one has to act \r\nfirmly  and  obey  the  representative  of  Kåñëa,  and  one  should  accept  the \r\ninstruction  of  the  bona  fide  spiritual  master  as  one’s  mission  in  life.

The  Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually \r\nelevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on \r\nthe  transcendental  plane.  Arjuna,  as  a  student  and  friend  of  Lord  Kåñëa,  is \r\nadvised to raise himself to the transcendental position of  Vedänta philosophy \r\nwhere, in the beginning, there is  brahma-jijïäsä, or questions on the supreme \r\ntranscendence.  All  the  living  entities  who  are  in  the  material  world  are \r\nstruggling  very  hard  for  existence.  For  them  the  Lord,  after  creation  of  the \r\nmaterial world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid  of the \r\nmaterial entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the \r\nkarma-käëòa chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is \r\noffered in the form of the  Upaniñads, which are part of different  Vedas, as the \r\nBhagavad-gétä  is  a  part  of  the  fifth  Veda,  namely  the  Mahäbhärata.  The \r\nUpaniñads mark the beginning of transcendental life. \r\n    As long as the material body exists,  there are actions and reactions in the \r\nmaterial  modes.  One  has  to  learn  tolerance  in  the  face  of  dualities  such  as \r\nhappiness  and  distress,  or  cold  and  warmth,  and  by  tolerating  such  dualities \r\nbecome  free  from  anxieties  regarding  gain  and  loss.  This  transcendental \r\nposition is achieved in full Kåñëa consciousness when one is fully dependent \r\non the good will of Kåñëa."

And  the  purpose  of  self-realization  is  clearly  stated  in  the \r\nFifteenth  Chapter  of  the Bhagavad-gétä  (15.15):  the  purpose  of  studying  the \r\nVedas   is   to   know   Lord   Kåñëa,   the   primeval   cause   of   everything.

It is not \r\npossible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations \r\nof  the  Vedic  rituals,  nor  is  it  possible  to  study  all  of  the  Vedänta  and  the \r\nUpaniñads thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources \r\nto execute the purposes of the  Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The \r\nbest purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of \r\nthe Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. \r\nWhen  Lord  Caitanya  was  asked  by  a  great  Vedic  scholar,  Prakäçänanda \r\nSarasvaté,  why  He,  the  Lord,  was  chanting  the  holy  name  of  the  Lord  like  a \r\nsentimentalist  instead  of  studying  Vedänta  philosophy,  the  Lord  replied  that \r\nHis spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to \r\nchant  the  holy  name  of  Lord  Kåñëa.  He  did  so,  and  became  ecstatic  like  a \r\nmadman.  In  this  Age  of  Kali,  most  of  the  population  is  foolish  and  not \r\nadequately  educated  to  understand  Vedänta  philosophy;  the  best  purpose  of \r\nVedänta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the \r\nLord. Vedänta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of \r\nthe  Vedänta philosophy is Lord Kåñëa; and  the highest Vedäntist is the great \r\nsoul  who  takes  pleasure  in  chanting  the  holy  name  of  the  Lord.  That  is  the \r\nultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism."

Most  people,  however,  are  servants  of  the \r\nsenses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer \r\nto  the  question  as  to  how  the  yogé  is  situated.  The  senses  are  compared  to \r\nvenomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The \r\nyogé, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents—like a snake \r\ncharmer.   He   never   allows   them   to   act   independently.   There   are   many \r\ninjunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not’s, and some of \r\nthem are do’s. Unless one is able to follow the do’s and the do-not’s, restricting \r\noneself  from  sense  enjoyment,  it  is  not  possible  to  be  firmly  fixed  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at \r\nany  moment  wind  up  his  senses  and  exhibit  them  again  at  any  time  for \r\nparticular  purposes.  Similarly,  the  senses  of  the  Kåñëa  conscious  persons  are \r\nused  only  for  some  particular  purpose  in  the  service  of  the  Lord  and  are \r\nwithdrawn  otherwise.  Arjuna  is  being  taught  here  to  use  his  senses  for  the \r\nservice  of  the  Lord,  instead  of  for  his  own  satisfaction.  Keeping  the  senses \r\nalways  in  the  service  of  the  Lord  is  the  example  set  by  the  analogy  of  the \r\ntortoise, who keeps the senses within."

As  illustrated  in  the  above-mentioned  verse  of  Çré \r\nYämunäcärya,   a   sincere   devotee   of   the   Lord   shuns   all   material   sense \r\nenjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of \r\nthe  Lord.  That  is  the  secret  of  success.  One  who  is  not,  therefore,  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness,  however  powerful  he  may  be  in  controlling  the  senses  by \r\nartificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense \r\npleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires."

Their  so-called  renunciation  is  called  phalgu,  or  less \r\nimportant. On the other hand, a person in Kåñëa consciousness knows how to \r\nuse  everything  in  the  service  of  the  Lord;  therefore  he  does  not  become  a \r\nvictim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, \r\nor the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries \r\nto avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kåñëa is the supreme enjoyer and \r\nthat  He  eats  all  that  is  offered  to  Him  in  devotion.  So,  after  offering  good \r\neatables  to  the  Lord,  the  devotee  takes  the  remnants,  called prasädam.  Thus \r\neverything  becomes  spiritualized,  and  there  is  no  danger  of  a  downfall.  The \r\ndevotee  takes  prasädam  in  Kåñëa  consciousness,  whereas  the  nondevotee \r\nrejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his \r\nartificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls \r\nhim down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul, \r\neven though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not \r\nhaving support in devotional service."

Khaöväìga \r\nMahäräja  attained  this  state  of  life  just  a  few  minutes  before  his  death,  by \r\nsurrendering  unto  Kåñëa.  Nirväëa  means  ending  the  process  of  materialistic \r\nlife. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion \r\nof  this  material  life,  but  Bhagavad-gétä  teaches  differently.  Actual  life  begins \r\nafter  the  completion  of  this  material  life.  For  the  gross  materialist  it  is \r\nsufficient  to  know  that  one  has  to  end  this  materialistic  way  of  life,  but  for \r\npersons   who   are   spiritually   advanced,   there   is   another   life   after   this \r\nmaterialistic  life.

The other class of men work in Kåñëa consciousness, as it is \r\nexplained  in  the  61st  verse  of  the  Second  Chapter.  The  Lord  has  explained, \r\nalso  in  the  39th  verse,  that  by  working  by  the  principles  of  buddhi-yoga,  or \r\nKåñëa  consciousness,  one  can  be  relieved  from  the  bonds  of  action;  and, \r\nfurthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly \r\nexplained in the 61st verse—that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the \r\nSupreme (or more specifically, on Kåñëa), and in this way all the senses can be \r\nbrought      under     control     very    easily.   Therefore,      both     the    yogas    are \r\ninterdependent,  as  religion  and  philosophy.  Religion  without  philosophy  is \r\nsentiment,  or  sometimes  fanaticism,  while  philosophy  without  religion  is \r\nmental speculation. The ultimate goal  is Kåñëa, because the philosophers who \r\nare also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä. The whole process is to \r\nunderstand  the  real  position  of  the  self  in  relation  to  the  Superself.  The \r\nindirect  process  is  philosophical  speculation,  by  which,  gradually,  one  may \r\ncome  to  the  point  of  Kåñëa  consciousness;  and  the  other  process  is  directly \r\nconnecting with everything in Kåñëa consciousness. Of these two, the path of \r\nKåñëa  consciousness  is  better  because  it  does  not  depend  on  purifying  the \r\nsenses  by  a  philosophical  process.  Kåñëa  consciousness  is  itself  the  purifying \r\nprocess,  and  by  the  direct  method  of  devotional  service  it  is  simultaneously \r\neasy and sublime."

But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the \r\ntranscendental worship of Viñëu is recommended. But ultimately all yajïas are \r\nmeant  for  gradual  promotion  to  the  transcendental  position.  For  ordinary \r\nmen, at least five yajïas, known as païca-mahä-yajïa, are necessary. \r\n    One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human \r\nsociety requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can \r\nmanufacture  anything.  Take,  for  example,  all  the  eatables  of  human  society. \r\nThese  eatables  include  grains,  fruits,  vegetables,  milk,  sugar,  etc.,  for  the \r\npersons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like \r\nmeats,  none  of  which  can  be  manufactured  by  men.  Then  again,  take  for \r\nexample heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life—none of \r\nthem can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, \r\nthere  can  be  no  profuse  sunlight,  moonlight,  rainfall,  breeze,  etc.,  without \r\nwhich no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the \r\nLord.   Even   for   our   manufacturing   enterprises,   we   require   so   many   raw \r\nmaterials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials—all \r\nof  which  are  supplied  by  the  agents  of  the  Lord,  with  the  purpose  that  we \r\nshould  make  proper  use  of  them  to  keep  ourselves  fit  and  healthy  for  the \r\npurpose   of   self-realization,   leading   to   the   ultimate   goal   of   life,   namely, \r\nliberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained \r\nby  performance  of  yajïas. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply \r\ntake supplies from the agents of the  Lord for sense gratification and become \r\nmore  and  more  entangled  in  material  existence, which is not the purpose of \r\ncreation, certainly we become thieves,  and therefore we are punished by the \r\nlaws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they \r\nhave no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. \r\nThey are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of \r\nhow  to  perform  yajïas.  Lord  Caitanya,  however,  inaugurated  the  easiest \r\nperformance of yajïa, namely the saìkértana-yajïa, which can be performed by \r\nanyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kåñëa consciousness."

The Supreme Lord, \r\nwho is known as the yajïa-puruña, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, \r\nis the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the \r\nbody serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra and Varuëa are appointed \r\nofficers who manage material affairs, and the  Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy \r\nthese  demigods  so  that  they  may  be  pleased  to  supply  air,  light  and  water \r\nsufficiently  to  produce  food  grains.  When  Lord  Kåñëa  is  worshiped,  the \r\ndemigods,   who   are   different   limbs   of   the   Lord,   are   also   automatically \r\nworshiped;  therefore  there  is  no  separate  need  to  worship  the  demigods.  For \r\nthis  reason,  the  devotees  of  the  Lord,  who  are  in  Kåñëa  consciousness,  offer \r\nfood to Kåñëa and then eat—a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By \r\nsuch action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the \r\nbody becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there \r\nis an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack \r\nof such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viñëu and then taken by \r\nus  makes  us  sufficiently  resistant  to  material  affection,  and  one  who  is \r\naccustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person \r\nin Kåñëa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kåñëa, can counteract all \r\nreactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of \r\nself-realization.  On  the  other  hand,  one  who  does  not  do  so  continues  to \r\nincrease  the  volume  of  sinful  action,  and  this  prepares  the  next  body  to \r\nresemble  hogs  and  dogs,  to  suffer  the  resultant  reactions  of  all  sins.  The \r\nmaterial  world  is  full  of  contaminations,  and  one  who  is  immunized  by \r\naccepting  prasädam  of  the  Lord  (food  offered  to  Viñëu)  is  saved  from  the \r\nattack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination. \r\n    Food  grains  or  vegetables  are  factually  eatables.

Therefore,  ultimately,  we  have  to \r\ndepend  on  the  production  of  the  field  and  not  on  the  production  of  big \r\nfactories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such \r\nrains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all \r\nservants  of  the  Lord.  The  Lord  can  be  satisfied  by  sacrifices;  therefore,  one \r\nwho  cannot  perform  them  will  find  himself  in  scarcity—that  is  the  law  of \r\nnature.  Yajïa,  specifically  the  saìkértana-yajïa  prescribed  for  this  age,  must \r\ntherefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply."

    "text": "Yajïärtha-karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Kåñëa only, \r\nis more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of \r\nthe  yajïa-puruña,  Viñëu,  then  we  must  find  out  the  direction  of  work  in \r\nBrahman,  or  the  transcendental  Vedas.  The  Vedas  are  therefore  codes  of \r\nworking directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is \r\ncalled  vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always \r\ntake direction from the  Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one \r\nhas to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to \r\nwork under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the \r\nVedas are directly manifested from the  breathing of the Supreme Personality \r\nof  Godhead.  It  is  said,  asya  mahato  bhütasya  niçvasitam  etad  yad  åg-vedo \r\nyajur-vedaù sämavedo ’tharväìgirasaù. “The four  Vedas—namely the Åg Veda, \r\nYajur  Veda,  Säma  Veda,  and  Atharva  Veda—are  all  emanations  from  the \r\nbreathing  of  the  great  Personality  of  Godhead.”  (Båhad-äraëyaka  Upaniñad \r\n4.5.11)  The  Lord,  being  omnipotent,  can  speak  by  breathing  air,  for  as  it  is \r\nconfirmed in the  Brahma-saàhitä, the Lord has the omnipotence to perform \r\nthrough each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the \r\nLord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In \r\nfact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living \r\nentities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb \r\nof material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such \r\nconditioned  souls  can  return  home,  back  to  Godhead.  We  should  always \r\nremember  that  the  conditioned  souls  in  material  nature  are  all  eager  for \r\nmaterial enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy \r\none’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called \r\nenjoyment.  It  is  a  chance  for  the  conditioned  souls  to  attain  liberation; \r\ntherefore  the  conditioned  souls  must  try  to  follow  the  process  of  yajïa  by \r\nbecoming  Kåñëa  conscious.  Even  those  who  have  not  followed  the  Vedic \r\ninjunctions may adopt the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, and that will take \r\nthe place of performance of Vedic yajïas, or karmas."

Therefore, the yajïas \r\nare   directly   aimed   at   the   particular   demigods   mentioned   in   the   Vedas. \r\nIndirectly, it is the practice of Kåñëa consciousness, because when one masters \r\nthe  performance  of  yajïas  one  is  sure  to  become  Kåñëa  conscious.

The  Lord \r\ninstructs that one has to become fully Kåñëa conscious to discharge duties, as if \r\nin  military  discipline.  Such  an  injunction  may  make  things  a  little  difficult; \r\nnevertheless  duties  must  be  carried  out,  with  dependence  on  Kåñëa,  because \r\nthat is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot \r\nbe  happy  independent  of  the  cooperation  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  because  the \r\neternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to \r\nthe desires of the Lord. Arjuna was therefore ordered by Çré Kåñëa to fight as if \r\nthe Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the \r\ngood  will  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  and  at  the  same  time  discharge  prescribed \r\nduties  without  claiming  proprietorship.  Arjuna  did  not  have  to  consider  the \r\norder of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the \r\nsoul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme \r\nSoul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully Kåñëa \r\nconscious, is called  adhyätma-cetas.

The  cashier  may \r\ncount  millions  of  dollars  for  his  employer,  but  he  does  not  claim  a  cent  for \r\nhimself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any \r\nindividual  person,  but  that  everything  belongs  to  the  Supreme  Lord.  That  is \r\nthe  real  purport  of  mayi,  or  “unto  Me.”  And  when  one  acts  in  such  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything.

There are many so-called \r\nspiritualists  who  outwardly  pose  as  advanced  in  the  science  but  inwardly  or \r\nprivately  are  completely  under  particular  modes  of  nature  which  they  are \r\nunable to surpass.

Kåñëa  consciousness \r\nhelps  one  to  get  out  of  the  material  entanglement,  even  though  one  may  be \r\nengaged  in  his  prescribed  duties  in  terms  of  material  existence.  Therefore, \r\nwithout  being  fully  in  Kåñëa  consciousness,  one  should  not  give  up  his \r\noccupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and \r\nbecome  a  so-called  yogé  or  transcendentalist  artificially.  It  is  better  to  be \r\nsituated  in  one’s  position  and  to  try  to  attain  Kåñëa  consciousness  under \r\nsuperior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of Kåñëa’s mäyä."

For   example,   sex   enjoyment   is   a   necessity   for   the \r\nconditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage \r\nties.

Materially,  prescribed \r\nduties are duties enjoined according to one’s psychophysical condition, under \r\nthe spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the \r\nspiritual master for the transcendental service of Kåñëa. But whether material \r\nor spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather \r\nthan imitate another’s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and \r\nduties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following \r\nthe authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under \r\nthe  spell  of  the  modes  of  material  nature,  one  should  follow  the  prescribed \r\nrules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a \r\nbrähmaëa, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a  kñatriya, \r\nwho is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a kñatriya it \r\nis  better  to  be  vanquished  following  the  rules  of  violence  than  to  imitate  a \r\nbrähmaëa who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse \r\nhis  heart  by  a  gradual  process,  not  abruptly.  However,  when  one  transcends \r\nthe modes of material nature and is fully situated in Kåñëa consciousness, he \r\ncan  perform  anything  and  everything  under  the  direction  of  a  bona  fide \r\nspiritual  master.  In  that  complete  stage  of  Kåñëa  consciousness,  the  kñatriya \r\nmay   act   as   a   brähmaëa,   or   a   brähmaëa   may   act   as   a   kñatriya.   In   the \r\ntranscendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For \r\nexample,  Viçvämitra  was  originally  a  kñatriya,  but  later  on  he  acted  as  a \r\nbrähmaëa,  whereas  Paraçuräma  was  a  brähmaëa  but  later  on  he  acted  as  a \r\nkñatriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is \r\non the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of \r\nmaterial  nature.  At  the  same  time,  he  must  have  a  full  sense  of  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness."

Wrath   is   the \r\nmanifestation  of  the  mode  of  ignorance;  these  modes  exhibit  themselves  as \r\nwrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being \r\ndegraded into the mode of ignorance,  is elevated to the mode of goodness by \r\nthe  prescribed  method  of  living  and  acting,  then  one  can  be  saved  from  the \r\ndegradation of wrath by spiritual attachment. \r\n    The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His \r\never-increasing spiritual bliss, and the  living entities are parts and parcels of \r\nthis spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their \r\nindependence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for \r\nsense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is \r\ncreated  by  the  Lord  to  give  facility  to  the  conditioned  souls  to  fulfill  these \r\nlustful   propensities,     and    when     completely      baffled   by   prolonged      lustful \r\nactivities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position. \r\n    This  inquiry  is  the  beginning  of  the  Vedänta-sütras,  wherein  it  is  said, \r\nathäto brahma jijïäsä: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme \r\nis defined in  Çrémad-Bhägavatam as janmädy asya yato ’nvayäd itarataç ca , or, \r\n“The origin of everything is  the Supreme Brahman.” Therefore the origin of \r\nlust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the \r\nSupreme,   or   transformed   into   Kåñëa   consciousness—or,   in   other   words, \r\ndesiring everything for Kåñëa—then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. \r\nHanumän, the great servitor of Lord Räma, exhibited his wrath by burning the \r\ngolden city of Rävaëa, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the \r\nLord. Here also, in Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath \r\nupon  his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, \r\nwhen they are employed in Kåñëa consciousness, become our friends instead of \r\nour enemies."

When love of \r\nGod deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. \r\nNonetheless, Kåñëa consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can \r\nbecome  a  lover  of  God  by  following  the  regulative  principles  of  devotional \r\nservice.  So,  from  any  stage  of  life,  or  from  the  time  of  understanding  its \r\nurgency,   one   can   begin   regulating   the   senses   in   Kåñëa   consciousness, \r\ndevotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead—the \r\nhighest perfectional stage of human life."

Therefore, the senses \r\nare superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is \r\nsuperior  consciousness,  or  Kåñëa  consciousness.  In  Kåñëa  consciousness  the \r\nsoul  makes  direct  connection  with  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead; \r\ntherefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends \r\nin  the  Supreme  Soul.

If, therefore, the \r\nsoul  is  directly  engaged  with  the  Supreme,  naturally  all  other  subordinates, \r\nnamely,  the  intelligence,  mind  and  senses,  will  be  automatically  engaged.  In \r\nthe  Kaöha  Upaniñad  there  is  a  similar  passage,  in  which  it  is  said  that  the \r\nobjects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to \r\nthe sense objects.

That  solves  the \r\nwhole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from \r\nthe objects of the senses.

If  by  intelligence  one  engages  one’s  mind  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness,   by   complete   surrender   unto   the   Supreme   Personality   of \r\nGodhead,  then,  automatically,  the  mind  becomes  stronger,  and  even  though \r\nthe senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than \r\nserpents  with  broken  fangs.

Manu, \r\nbeing the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahäräja Ikñväku, the king of \r\nthis   earth   planet   and   forefather   of   the   Raghu   dynasty,   in   which   Lord \r\nRämacandra  appeared.”  Therefore,  Bhagavad-gétä  existed  in  human  society \r\nfrom the time of Mahäräja Ikñväku. \r\n    At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of \r\nthe Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dväpara-yuga \r\n(800,000 years), and before that there was Tretä-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, \r\nsome 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gétä to his disciple and son \r\nMahäräja Ikñväku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu \r\nis calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. \r\nAccepting that before the birth of Manu the  Gétä was spoken by the Lord to \r\nHis disciple the sun-god Vivasvän, a rough estimate is that the Gétä was spoken \r\nat least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two \r\nmillion years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand \r\nyears ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the  Gétä, according to \r\nthe  Gétä itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Çré Kåñëa. It \r\nwas  spoken  to  the  sun-god  Vivasvän  because  he  is  also  a  kñatriya  and  is  the \r\nfather of  all kñatriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the  sürya-vaàça \r\nkñatriyas. Because  Bhagavad-gétä is as good as the  Vedas, being spoken by the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is  apauruñeya, superhuman. \r\nSince   the   Vedic   instructions   are   accepted   as   they   are,   without   human"

Anyway,  since  Kåñëa  is  the  authority \r\naccepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that Kåñëa would \r\ndescribe  Himself  without  being  depicted  by  the  demons,  who  always  try  to \r\ndistort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is \r\nnecessary  that  everyone,  for  his  own  interest,  know  the  science  of  Kåñëa. \r\nTherefore,  when  Kåñëa  Himself  speaks  about  Himself,  it  is  auspicious  for  all \r\nthe worlds.

A \r\ndevotee of Kåñëa, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of \r\nthe transcendental position of Kåñëa. Arjuna’s putting this question before the \r\nLord  is  simply  an  attempt  by  the  devotee  to  defy  the  atheistic  attitude  of \r\npersons  who  consider  Kåñëa  to  be  an  ordinary  human  being,  subject  to  the \r\nmodes of material nature."

He is like the vaidurya stone, which \r\nchanges color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the \r\npure,  unalloyed  devotees,  but  not  by  a  simple  study  of  the  Vedas  (vedeñu \r\ndurlabham  adurlabham  ätma-bhaktau).  Devotees  like  Arjuna  are  constant \r\ncompanions  of  the  Lord,  and  whenever  the  Lord  incarnates,  the  associate \r\ndevotees  also  incarnate  in  order  to  serve  the  Lord  in  different  capacities. \r\nArjuna is one of these devotees, and in  this verse it is understood that some \r\nmillions of years ago when Lord Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god \r\nVivasvän, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference \r\nbetween  the  Lord  and  Arjuna  is  that  the  Lord  remembered  the  incident \r\nwhereas  Arjuna  could  not  remember.  That  is  the  difference  between  the \r\npart-and-parcel  living  entity  and  the  Supreme  Lord.  Although  Arjuna  is \r\naddressed  herein  as  the  mighty  hero  who  could  subdue  the  enemies,  he  is \r\nunable  to  recall  what  had  happened  in  his  various  past  births.  Therefore,  a \r\nliving entity, however great he may be  in the material estimation, can never \r\nequal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is \r\ncertainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is \r\ndescribed in the  Brahma-saàhitä as infallible (acyuta), which means that He \r\nnever forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the \r\nLord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living \r\nentity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he \r\nsometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can \r\nat once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee \r\nor a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these \r\ndescriptions  in  the  Gétä  cannot  be  understood  by  demonic  brains.  Kåñëa \r\nremembered acts which were performed  by Him millions of years before, but \r\nArjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kåñëa and Arjuna are eternal in"

We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to \r\nhis change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His \r\nsac-cid-änanda  body.  He  is  advaita,  which  means  there  is  no  distinction \r\nbetween     His   body    and    Himself.    Everything     in   relation    to   Him    is \r\nspirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And \r\nbecause the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different \r\nfrom that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material \r\nplatform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature \r\nof the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse."

    "text": "The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may \r\nappear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many \r\npast  “births,”  whereas  a  common  man  cannot  remember  what  he  has  done \r\neven a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same \r\ntime one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer \r\nimmediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was \r\ndoing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim \r\nto  be  God,  or  Kåñëa.  One  should  not  be  misled  by  such  meaningless  claims. \r\nThen again, the Lord explains His prakåti, or His form. Prakåti means “nature,” \r\nas well as svarüpa, or “one’s own form.” The Lord says that He appears in His \r\nown body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes \r\nfrom one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in \r\nthe present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material \r\nworld, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to \r\nanother. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so \r\nin  the  same  original  body,  by  His  internal  potency.  In  other  words,  Kåñëa \r\nappears  in  this  material  world  in  His  original  eternal  form,  with  two  hands, \r\nholding  a  flute.  He  appears  exactly  in  His  eternal  body,  uncontaminated  by \r\nthis material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and \r\nis Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary \r\nliving entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, \r\nit  still  appears  that  Lord  Kåñëa  grows  from  childhood  to  boyhood  and  from \r\nboyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At \r\nthe time of the Battle of Kurukñetra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, \r\nin  other  words,  He  had  sufficiently  aged  by  material  calculations.  Still  He \r\nlooked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a \r\npicture of Kåñëa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is \r\nthe oldest person in the whole creation—past, present, and future. Neither His \r\nbody  nor  His  intelligence  ever  deteriorates  or  changes.  Therefore,  it  is  clear \r\nthat in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal \r\nform  of  bliss  and  knowledge,  changeless  in  His  transcendental  body  and"

Factually,  His  appearance  and  disappearance  is  like  the  sun’s \r\nrising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the \r\nsun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our \r\neyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its \r\nfixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the \r\nappearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord Kåñëa’s \r\nappearance  and  disappearance  are  completely  different  from  that  of  any \r\nordinary,  common  living  entity,  it  is  evident  that  He  is  eternal,  blissful \r\nknowledge   by   His   internal   potency—and   He   is   never   contaminated   by \r\nmaterial  nature.  The  Vedas  also  confirm  that  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead       is   unborn      yet    He     still  appears     to    take    His    birth    in \r\nmultimanifestations.  The  Vedic  supplementary  literatures  also  confirm  that \r\neven though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change \r\nof body. In the  Bhägavatam, He appears before His mother as Näräyaëa, with \r\nfour  hands  and  the  decorations  of  the  six  kinds  of  full  opulences.  His \r\nappearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon \r\nthe living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, \r\nand  not  on  mental  concoctions  or  imaginations,  which  the  impersonalist \r\nwrongly thinks the Lord’s forms to be. The word mäyä, or ätma-mäyä, refers to \r\nthe Lord’s causeless mercy, according to the Viçva-koça dictionary. The Lord is \r\nconscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common \r\nliving entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another \r\nbody. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and \r\nsuperhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always \r\nthe same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and \r\nself, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why \r\nthe  Lord  appears  and  disappears  in  this  world. This is explained in the next \r\nverse."

The Vedas are \r\nalso accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmä, from within \r\nhis heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders \r\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam \r\n[SB    6.3.19]).    These     principles     are    clearly    indicated      throughout       the \r\nBhagavad-gétä. The purpose of the  Vedas is to establish such principles under \r\nthe order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the \r\nGétä, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and \r\nnothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto \r\nHim; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord \r\nappears.   From   the   Bhägavatam   we   understand   that   Lord   Buddha   is   the \r\nincarnation  of  Kåñëa  who  appeared  when  materialism  was  rampant  and \r\nmaterialists  were  using  the  pretext  of  the  authority  of  the  Vedas.  Although \r\nthere are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for \r\nparticular  purposes  in  the  Vedas,  people  of  demonic  tendency  still  took  to \r\nanimal  sacrifice  without  reference  to  the  Vedic  principles.  Lord  Buddha \r\nappeared  to  stop  this  nonsense  and  to  establish  the  Vedic  principles  of \r\nnonviolence.  Therefore  each  and  every  avatära,  or  incarnation  of  the  Lord, \r\nhas a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. \r\nNo one should be accepted as an avatära unless he is referred to by scriptures. \r\nIt  is  not  a  fact  that  the  Lord  appears  only  on  Indian  soil.  He  can  manifest \r\nHimself  anywhere  and  everywhere,  and  whenever  He  desires  to  appear.  In \r\neach  and  every  incarnation,  He  speaks  as  much  about  religion  as  can  be \r\nunderstood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But \r\nthe mission is the same—to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to \r\nthe  principles  of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes \r\nHe sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or \r\nHimself in some disguised form. \r\n    The  principles  of  the  Bhagavad-gétä  were  spoken  to  Arjuna,  and,  for  that \r\nmatter,  to  other  highly  elevated  persons,  because  he  was  highly  advanced \r\ncompared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals \r\nfour is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner’s arithmetic class \r\nand   in   the   advanced   class   as   well.

In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are \r\ntaught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied  circumstances. The \r\nhigher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and \r\nthe four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of \r\nthe mission of incarnations is to arouse Kåñëa consciousness everywhere. Such \r\nconsciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances."

As far  as the atheistic are concerned, it is \r\nnot necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He \r\ndid with the demons Rävaëa and Kaàsa. The Lord has many agents who are \r\nquite  competent  to  vanquish  demons.  But  the  Lord  especially  descends  to \r\nappease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The \r\ndemon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. \r\nAlthough      Prahläda      Mahäräja      was   the    son   of   Hiraëyakaçipu,       he    was \r\nnonetheless  persecuted  by  his  father;  although Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa, \r\nwas the sister of Kaàsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only \r\nbecause Kåñëa was to be born of them. So Lord Kåñëa appeared primarily to \r\ndeliver    Devaké,     rather     than    kill   Kaàsa,      but   both     were    performed \r\nsimultaneously.  Therefore  it  is  said  here  that  to  deliver  the  devotee  and \r\nvanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations. \r\n    In  the  Caitanya-caritämåta  of  Kåñëadäsa  Kaviräja,  the  following  verses \r\n(Madhya 20.263–264) summarize these principles of incarnation:"

One  who  can  understand  the  truth  of  the  appearance  of  the \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead  is  already  liberated  from  material  bondage,  and \r\ntherefore  he  returns  to  the  kingdom  of  God  immediately  after  quitting  this \r\npresent  material  body.  Such  liberation  of  the  living  entity  from  material \r\nbondage  is  not  at  all  easy.  The  impersonalists  and  the  yogés  attain  liberation \r\nonly after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they \r\nachieve—merging   into   the   impersonal   brahmajyoti   of   the   Lord—is   only \r\npartial,  and  there  is  the  risk  of  returning  to  this  material  world.

Anyone  who \r\nunderstands Lord Kåñëa to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord “You \r\nare  the  same  Supreme  Brahman,  the  Personality  of  Godhead,”  is  certainly \r\nliberated  instantly,  and  consequently  his  entrance  into  the  transcendental \r\nassociation of the Lord is guaranteed.

To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has \r\nto take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, \r\nand follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last \r\nstage of the devotional life is called bhäva, or transcendental love of Godhead. \r\n    According to Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.4.15–16), the science of devotional \r\nservice:"

In  the  next  stage  one  becomes  initiated  by  an  elevated \r\nspiritual  master,  and  under  his  instruction  the  neophyte  devotee  begins  the \r\nprocess  of  devotional  service.

But \r\nKåñëa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kåñëa is the \r\nobject  of  everyone’s  realization,  and  thus  anyone  and  everyone  is  satisfied \r\naccording to one’s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, Kåñëa \r\nreciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the \r\ndevotee wants Him. One devotee may want Kåñëa as supreme master, another \r\nas his personal friend, another as his son, and still another as his lover. Kåñëa \r\nrewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love \r\nfor Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, \r\nand  they  are  equally  exchanged  by  the  Lord  with  the  different  types  of \r\nworshipers.

Actually,  the \r\ndemigods are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and \r\nparcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The  Vedas say,  nityo \r\nnityänäm:   God   is   one.     Éçvaraù   paramaù   kåñëaù.   The   Supreme   God   is \r\none—Kåñëa—and  the  demigods  are  delegated  with  powers  to  manage  this \r\nmaterial world. These demigods are all living entities (nityänäm) with different \r\ngrades    of   material    power.     They     cannot     be   equal    to   the   Supreme \r\nGod—Näräyaëa,  Viñëu,  or  Kåñëa.  Anyone  who  thinks  that  God  and  the \r\ndemigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or päñaëòé. Even the great \r\ndemigods like Brahmä and Çiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In \r\nfact,  the    Lord    is  worshiped     by   demigods     such    as  Brahmä      and    Çiva \r\n(çiva-viriïci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who \r\nare    worshiped       by    foolish    men      under     the     misunderstanding        of \r\nanthropomorphism  or  zoomorphism.

However, foolish people (håta-jïäna) worship the demigods because \r\nthey want immediate results.

The demigods of this \r\nmaterial world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of \r\nthis  material  world.  The  boons  of  the  demigods  are  material  and  temporary. \r\nBoth  the  material  worlds  and  their  inhabitants,  including  the  demigods  and \r\ntheir  worshipers,  are  bubbles  in  the  cosmic  ocean.

To    achieve    such \r\ntemporary  things,  people  worship  the  demigods  or  powerful  men  in  human \r\nsociety.  If  a  man  gets  some  ministership  in  the  government  by  worshiping  a \r\npolitical leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are \r\ntherefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or “big guns” in order to achieve \r\ntemporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are \r\nnot  interested  in  Kåñëa  consciousness  for  the  permanent  solution  to  the \r\nhardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get \r\na little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered \r\nliving entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely \r\ninterested  in  Kåñëa  consciousness.  They  are  mostly  interested  in  material \r\nenjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity."

The   system   of   Kåñëa   consciousness   was   first \r\nnarrated  to  the  sun-god,  the  sun-god  explained  it  to  his  son  Manu,  Manu \r\nexplained it to his son Ikñväku, and the system is current on this earth from \r\nthat very remote time.

Otherwise  even  the  most \r\nintelligent  men  will  be  bewildered  regarding  the  standard  actions  of  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness.

Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid \r\ndown  by  the  Lord  Himself.  Dharmaà  tu  säkñäd  bhagavat-praëétam  (Bhäg. \r\n6.3.19). No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. \r\nOne  must  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  great  authorities  like  Brahmä,  Çiva, \r\nNärada,  Manu,  the  Kumäras,  Kapila,  Prahläda,  Bhéñma,  Çukadeva  Gosvämé, \r\nYamaräja,  Janaka,  and  Bali  Mahäräja.  By  mental  speculation  one  cannot \r\nascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy \r\nto His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what \r\ninaction is. Only action performed in Kåñëa consciousness can deliver a person \r\nfrom the entanglement of material existence."

    "text": "How  activities  in  Kåñëa  consciousness  can  lead  one  ultimately  to  the \r\nspiritual   goal   is   described   here.   There   are   various   activities   in   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, and all of them will be  described in the following verses. But, \r\nfor  the  present,  just  the  principle  of  Kåñëa  consciousness  is  described.  A \r\nconditioned  soul,  entangled  in  material  contamination,  is  sure  to  act  in  the \r\nmaterial atmosphere, and yet he has to  get out of such an environment. The \r\nprocess by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere \r\nis Kåñëa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder \r\nof the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk \r\nproduct, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured \r\nby Kåñëa  consciousness as set forth here in the  Gétä. This process is generally \r\nknown  as  yajïa,  or  activities  (sacrifices)  simply meant for the satisfaction of \r\nViñëu, or Kåñëa. The more the activities of the material world are performed \r\nin Kåñëa consciousness, or for Viñëu only, the more the atmosphere becomes \r\nspiritualized  by  complete  absorption.  The  word  brahma  (Brahman)  means \r\n“spiritual.” The Lord is spiritual, and  the rays of His transcendental body are \r\ncalled brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in \r\nthat  brahmajyoti,  but  when  the  jyoti  is  covered  by  illusion  (mäyä)  or  sense \r\ngratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by \r\nKåñëa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kåñëa consciousness, the \r\nconsuming       agent    of  such    an    offering   or   contribution,   the   process   of \r\nconsumption,        the     contributor,      and     the     result    are—all       combined \r\ntogether—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by \r\nmäyä is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth \r\nregains  its  spiritual  quality.  Kåñëa  consciousness  is  the  process  of  converting \r\nthe illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is \r\nfully  absorbed  in  Kåñëa  consciousness,  it  is  said  to  be  in  samädhi,  or  trance. \r\nAnything   done   in   such   transcendental   consciousness   is   called   yajïa,   or \r\nsacrifice  for  the  Absolute.  In  that  condition  of  spiritual  consciousness,  the \r\ncontributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the \r\nperformance,  and  the  result  or  ultimate  gain—everything—becomes  one  in"

All the \r\ndifferent  varieties  of  sacrifice  can  be  placed  within  two  primary  divisions: \r\nnamely,      sacrifice    of   worldly     possessions     and     sacrifice    in   pursuit    of \r\ntranscendental knowledge. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness sacrifice all \r\nmaterial  possessions  for  the  satisfaction  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  while  others, \r\nwho     want    some     temporary      material    happiness,      sacrifice   their    material \r\npossessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who \r\nare  impersonalists,  sacrifice  their  identity  by  merging  into  the  existence  of \r\nimpersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by \r\nthe   Supreme   Lord   for   the   maintenance   and   supervision   of   all   material \r\nfunctions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who \r\nare interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices \r\naccording to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-éçvara-vädé, or believers in \r\nmany  gods.  But  others,  who  worship  the  impersonal  feature  of  the  Absolute \r\nTruth  and  regard  the  forms  of  the  demigods  as  temporary,  sacrifice  their \r\nindividual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences \r\nby  merging  into  the  existence  of  the  Supreme.  Such  impersonalists  sacrifice \r\ntheir  time  in  philosophical  speculation  to  understand  the  transcendental \r\nnature  of  the  Supreme.  In  other  words,  the  fruitive  workers  sacrifice  their \r\nmaterial     possessions     for   material    enjoyment,      whereas      the   impersonalist \r\nsacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence \r\nof the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme \r\nBrahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. \r\nThe  Kåñëa  conscious  person,  like  Arjuna,  however,  sacrifices  everything  for \r\nthe  satisfaction  of  Kåñëa,  and  thus  all  his  material  possessions  as  well  as  his \r\nown self—everything—is sacrificed for Kåñëa. Thus, he is the first-class yogé; \r\nbut he does not lose his individual existence."

In  the \r\nYoga-sütra of Pataïjali, the soul is called pratyag-ätmä and paräg-ätmä. As long \r\nas the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called paräg-ätmä, but as soon as \r\nthe  same  soul  becomes  detached  from  such  sense  enjoyment  it  is  called \r\npratyag-ätmä. The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work \r\nwithin  the  body,  and  this  is  perceived  through  the  breathing  system.  The \r\nPataïjali system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the \r\nbody’s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air \r\nwithin   become   favorable   for   purifying   the   soul   of   material   attachment. \r\nAccording   to   this   yoga   system,   pratyag-ätmä   is   the   ultimate   goal.   This \r\npratyag-ätmä is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with \r\nthe  sense  objects,  like  the  ear  for  hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, \r\ntongue  for  tasting,  hand  for  touching,  and  all  of  them  are  thus  engaged  in \r\nactivities outside the self. They are called the functions of the präëa-väyu. The \r\napäna-väyu      goes    downwards,       vyäna-väyu      acts    to   shrink    and    expand, \r\nsamäna-väyu adjusts equilibrium,  udäna-väyu goes upwards—and when one is \r\nenlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization."

All  these  charitable \r\nactivities  are  called  dravyamaya-yajïa.  There  are  others  who,  for  higher \r\nelevation  in  life  or  for  promotion  to  higher  planets  within  the  universe, \r\nvoluntarily     accept    many      kinds    of  austerities    such    as   candräyaëa      and \r\ncäturmäsya.  These  processes  entail  severe  vows  for  conducting  life  under \r\ncertain rigid rules. For example, under the cäturmäsya vow the candidate does \r\nnot shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat \r\ncertain  foods,  does  not  eat  twice  in  a  day  or  does  not  leave  home.  Such \r\nsacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yajïa.

Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; \r\ntherefore,  unless  and  until  one  is  situated  on  a  platform  apart  from  sense \r\ngratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of \r\nfull   knowledge,   full   bliss   and   full   life.   This   platform   is   in   the   eternal \r\natmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help \r\none to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this \r\nadvancement in life, not only does one become happy and opulent in this life, \r\nbut also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging \r\ninto the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead, Kåñëa."

In other words, existence in the material world is due to the \r\nmultiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and \r\nsinful life is the cause of one’s dragging on  in material existence. The human \r\nform   of   life   is   the   only   loophole   by   which   one   may   get   out   of   this \r\nentanglement. The  Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing \r\nout the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, \r\nat last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of \r\nreligion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically \r\nsolves our economic problems. By performance of  yajïa we can have  enough \r\nfood,  enough  milk,  etc.—even  if  there  is  a  so-called  increase  of  population. \r\nWhen  the  body  is  fully  supplied,  naturally  the  next  stage  is  to  satisfy  the \r\nsenses.  The  Vedas  prescribe,  therefore,  sacred  marriage  for  regulated  sense \r\ngratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from \r\nmaterial  bondage,  and  the  highest  perfection  of  liberated  life  is  to  associate \r\nwith  the  Supreme  Lord.  Perfection  is  achieved  by  performance  of  yajïa \r\n(sacrifice),  as  described  above.  Now,  if  a  person  is  not  inclined  to  perform \r\nyajïa according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life even in this body, \r\nand  what  to  speak  of  another  body  on  another  planet?  There  are  different \r\ngrades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there \r\nis immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajïa. But the \r\nhighest  kind  of  happiness  that  a  man  can  achieve  is  to  be  promoted  to  the \r\nspiritual    planets    by   practice    of   Kåñëa     consciousness.

No  one  can  be  spiritually \r\nrealized  by  manufacturing  his  own  process,  as  is  the  fashion  of  the  foolish \r\npretenders.       The      Bhägavatam         (6.3.19)     says,     dharmaà        tu     säkñäd \r\nbhagavat-praëétam:  the  path  of  religion  is  directly  enunciated  by  the  Lord. \r\nTherefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the \r\nright path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress \r\nin spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the \r\nknowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and \r\none  should  serve  the  spiritual  master  like  a  menial  servant,  without  false \r\nprestige.  Satisfaction  of  the  self-realized  spiritual  master  is  the  secret  of \r\nadvancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper \r\ncombination  for  spiritual  understanding.  Unless  there  is  submission  and \r\nservice, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One \r\nmust  be  able  to  pass  the  test  of  the  spiritual  master,  and  when  he  sees  the \r\ngenuine  desire  of  the  disciple,  he  automatically  blesses  the  disciple  with \r\ngenuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd \r\ninquiries  are  condemned.  Not  only  should  one  hear  submissively  from  the \r\nspiritual  master,  but  one  must  also  get  a  clear  understanding  from  him,  in \r\nsubmission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature \r\nvery kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is \r\nalways  ready  to  render  service,  the  reciprocation  of  knowledge  and  inquiries \r\nbecomes perfect."

All Rights Reserved. \r\n﻿    For  want  of  sufficient  knowledge  in  the  absolute  science,  we  are  now \r\ncovered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kåñëa. \r\nAlthough  we  are  separated  parts  of  Kåñëa,  we  are  nevertheless  not  different \r\nfrom Him. The bodily difference  of the living entities is  mäyä, or not actual \r\nfact. We are all meant to satisfy Kåñëa. By mäyä alone Arjuna thought that the \r\ntemporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his \r\neternal  spiritual  relationship  with  Kåñëa.  The  whole  teaching  of  the  Gétä  is \r\ntargeted  toward  this  end:  that  a  living  being,  as  Kåñëa’s  eternal  servitor, \r\ncannot be separated from Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from \r\nKåñëa is called  mäyä. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the \r\nSupreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose since time \r\nimmemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, \r\netc.  Such  bodily  differences  arise  from  forgetfulness  of  the  transcendental \r\nservice  of  the  Lord.  But  when  one  is  engaged  in  transcendental  service \r\nthrough Kåñëa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. \r\nOne can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master \r\nand thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to Kåñëa. Perfect \r\nknowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, is the supreme shelter for all living \r\nentities,  and  giving  up  such  shelter,  the  living  entities  are  deluded  by  the \r\nmaterial energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under \r\ndifferent  standards  of  material  identity,  they  become  forgetful  of  Kåñëa. \r\nWhen,   however,   such   deluded   living   entities   become   situated   in   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as \r\nconfirmed  in  the  Bhägavatam  (2.10.6):  muktir  hitvänyathä-rüpaà  svarüpeëa \r\nvyavasthitiù. Liberation means to be situated in one’s constitutional position as \r\nan eternal servitor of Kåñëa (Kåñëa consciousness)."

All Rights Reserved. \r\n﻿    The  yoga  system  instructed  in  this  chapter  is  called  sanätana-yoga,  or \r\neternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of \r\nsacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one’s material possessions, and the \r\nother is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of \r\none’s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such \r\nsacrifice  becomes  material.  But  one  who  performs  such  sacrifices  with  a \r\nspiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we \r\ncome  to  spiritual  activities,  we  find  that  these  are  also  divided  into  two: \r\nnamely, understanding of one’s own self (or one’s constitutional position), and \r\nthe truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the \r\npath of  Bhagavad-gétä as it is can very easily understand these two important \r\ndivisions  of  spiritual  knowledge.  For  him  there  is  no  difficulty  in  obtaining \r\nperfect  knowledge  of  the  self  as  part  and  parcel  of  the  Lord.  And  such \r\nunderstanding  is  beneficial,  for  such  a  person  can  easily  understand  the \r\ntranscendental  activities  of  the  Lord.  In  the  beginning  of  this  chapter,  the \r\ntranscendental  activities  of  the  Lord  were  discussed  by  the  Supreme  Lord \r\nHimself. One who does not understand the instructions of the Gétä is faithless, \r\nand is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded \r\nto him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand \r\nthe real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of \r\nGodhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual \r\nacceptance  of  the  principles  of  Kåñëa  consciousness.  Kåñëa  consciousness  is \r\nawakened   by   different   types   of   sacrifices   to   the   demigods,   sacrifice   to \r\nBrahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in \r\npracticing   mystic   yoga,   in   penance,   in   forgoing   material   possessions,   in \r\nstudying     the    Vedas,    and    in   partaking      of   the    social   institution     called \r\nvarëäçrama-dharma.  All  of  these  are  known  as  sacrifice,  and  all  of  them  are \r\nbased on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor \r\nis   self-realization.   One   who   seeks   that   objective   is   the   real   student   of \r\nBhagavad-gétä,  but  one  who  doubts  the  authority  of  Kåñëa  falls  back.  One  is \r\ntherefore advised to study Bhagavad-gétä, or any other scripture, under a bona \r\nfide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is \r\nin  the  disciplic  succession  from  time  eternal,  and  he  does  not  deviate  at  all"

Therefore action in Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of \r\nfalling.   Renunciation   without   Kåñëa   consciousness   is   incomplete,   as   is \r\nconfirmed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.258):"

One  should  understand  that, \r\nfactually,   nothing   belongs   to   anyone.   Then   where   is   the   question   of \r\nrenunciation?  One  who  knows  that  everything  is  Kåñëa’s  property  is  always \r\nsituated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to Kåñëa, everything should \r\nbe  employed  in  the  service  of  Kåñëa.  This  perfect  form  of  action  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness  is  far  better  than  any  amount  of  artificial  renunciation  by  a \r\nsannyäsé of the Mäyävädé school."

The \r\nMäyävädé      sannyäsés     also   study   the    Vedänta-sütras,      but   use   their    own \r\ncommentary, called Çäréraka-bhäñya, written by Çaìkaräcärya. The students of \r\nthe  Bhägavata  school  are  engaged  in  the  devotional  service  of  the  Lord, \r\naccording  to  päïcarätriké  regulations,  and  therefore  the  Vaiñëava  sannyäsés \r\nhave  multiple  engagements  in  the  transcendental  service  of  the  Lord.  The \r\nVaiñëava  sannyäsés have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they \r\nperform  various  activities  in  their  devotional  service  to  the  Lord.  But  the \r\nMäyävädé  sannyäsés,  engaged  in  the  studies  of  Säìkhya  and  Vedänta  and \r\nspeculation,  cannot  relish  the  transcendental  service  of  the  Lord.  Because \r\ntheir  studies  become  very  tedious,  they  sometimes  become  tired  of  Brahman \r\nspeculation,  and  thus  they  take  shelter  of  the  Bhägavatam  without  proper \r\nunderstanding.  Consequently  their  study  of  the  Çrémad-Bhägavatam  becomes \r\ntroublesome.  Dry  speculations  and  impersonal  interpretations  by  artificial \r\nmeans are all useless for the Mäyävädé sannyäsés. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés, who \r\nare   engaged   in   devotional   service,   are   happy   in   the   discharge   of   their \r\ntranscendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into \r\nthe  kingdom  of  God.  The  Mäyävädé  sannyäsés  sometimes  fall  down  from  the \r\npath    of   self-realization    and    again    enter    into   material    activities    of   a \r\nphilanthropic       and    altruistic   nature,    which      are   nothing     but    material \r\nengagements.  Therefore,  the  conclusion  is  that  those  who  are  engaged  in \r\nKåñëa  conscious  activities  are  better  situated  than  the  sannyäsés  engaged  in \r\nsimple speculation about what is Brahman and what is not Brahman, although \r\nthey too come to Kåñëa consciousness, after many births."

So, spiritually, no one \r\nwas killed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Only their dresses were changed by \r\nthe  order  of  Kåñëa,  who  was  personally  present.  Therefore  Arjuna,  while \r\nfighting on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, was not really fighting at all; he was \r\nsimply  carrying  out  the  orders  of  Kåñëa  in  full  Kåñëa  consciousness.

A living entity is, by superior \r\nnature,  full  of  knowledge.  Nevertheless,  he  is  prone  to  be  influenced  by \r\nignorance  due  to  his  limited  power.  The  Lord  is  omnipotent,  but  the  living \r\nentity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is  aëu, or \r\natomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. \r\nSuch desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living \r\nentity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, \r\nbut the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular \r\nsituation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the \r\nembodied  soul  identifies  himself  with  the  circumstantial  material  body  and \r\nbecomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is \r\nthe constant companion of the living entity as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul, \r\nand therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can \r\nsmell  the  flavor  of  a  flower  by  being  near  it.  Desire  is  a  subtle  form  of \r\nconditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his  desire as he deserves: \r\nMan proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent \r\nin fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, \r\nbeing  neutral  to  everyone,  does  not  interfere  with  the  desires  of  the  minute \r\nindependent living entities. However, when one desires Kåñëa, the Lord takes \r\nspecial care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to \r\nHim and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, eña u hy eva \r\nsädhu karma kärayati taà yam ebhyo lokebhya unninéñate. eña u eväsädhu karma \r\nkärayati  yam  adho  ninéñate:  “The  Lord  engages  the  living  entity  in  pious \r\nactivities  so  that  he  may  be  elevated.

And  what  is  that \r\nknowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Kåñëa, as \r\nis said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän \r\nmäà prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect \r\nin knowledge surrenders unto Kåñëa, or when one attains Kåñëa consciousness, \r\nthen everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the \r\ndaytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when \r\nhe unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of \r\nnescience.  If  a  living  entity  is  God,  then  how  can  he  become  bewildered  by \r\nnescience? Does God become bewildered  by nescience? If so, then nescience, \r\nor Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person \r\nwho is in perfect Kåñëa consciousness.  Therefore, one has to seek out such a \r\nbona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kåñëa consciousness is, \r\nfor  Kåñëa  consciousness  will  certainly  drive  away  all  nescience,  as  the  sun \r\ndrives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he \r\nis not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to \r\ndiscriminate  between  the  soul  and  the  Supersoul.  However,  he  can  know \r\neverything  well  if  he  cares  to  take  shelter  of  the  perfect,  bona  fide  Kåñëa \r\nconscious  spiritual  master.  One  can  know  God  and  one’s  relationship  with \r\nGod only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative \r\nof  God  never  claims  that  he  is  God,  although  he  is  paid  all  the  respect \r\nordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the \r\ndistinction between God and the living entity. Lord Çré Kåñëa therefore stated \r\nin the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the \r\nLord  also  is  individual.  They  were  all  individuals  in  the  past,  they  are \r\nindividuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, \r\neven after liberation.

Such  an  understanding  of  the  Supreme  is  real \r\nknowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different \r\nspecies  of  life,  the  Lord  is  equally  kind  to  everyone  because  He  treats  every \r\nliving being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Paramätmä regardless of the \r\ncircumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Paramätmä is present both in \r\nthe outcaste and in the  brähmaëa, although the body of a  brähmaëa and that \r\nof  an  outcaste  are  not  the  same.  The  bodies  are  material  productions  of \r\ndifferent modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the \r\nbody are of the same spiritual quality.

When one is well situated in devotional service, \r\none comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the \r\nLord in the sphere of one’s activity.

The   breathing   movement   is   restrained   within   the   nostrils   by \r\nneutralizing the up-moving and down-moving air within the body. By practice \r\nof such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward \r\nsense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme. \r\n    This  yoga  process  helps  one  become  free  from  all  kinds  of  fear  and  anger \r\nand thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In \r\nother  words,  Kåñëa  consciousness  is  the  easiest  process  of  executing  yoga \r\nprinciples.  This  will  be  thoroughly  explained  in  the  next  chapter.  A  Kåñëa \r\nconscious  person,  however,  being  always  engaged  in  devotional  service,  does \r\nnot  risk  losing  his  senses  to  some  other  engagement.  This  is  a  better  way  of \r\ncontrolling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga."

    "text": "The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious \r\nto attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for \r\npeace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gétä. The greatest peace \r\nformula  is  simply  this:  Lord  Kåñëa  is  the  beneficiary  in  all  human  activities. \r\nMen should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because \r\nHe is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater \r\nthan He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Çiva and Lord \r\nBrahmä.  In  the   Vedas  (Çvetäçvatara  Upaniñad   6.7)  the  Supreme  Lord  is \r\ndescribed as tam éçvaräëäà paramaà maheçvaraà. Under the spell of illusion, \r\nliving  entities  are  trying  to  be  lords  of  all  they  survey,  but  actually  they  are \r\ndominated  by  the  material  energy  of  the  Lord.  The  Lord  is  the  master  of \r\nmaterial  nature,  and  the  conditioned  souls  are  under  the  stringent  rules  of \r\nmaterial nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to \r\nachieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense \r\nof Kåñëa consciousness: Lord Kåñëa is the supreme predominator, and all living \r\nentities,  including  the  great  demigods,  are  His  subordinates.  One  can  attain \r\nperfect peace only in complete Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    This  Fifth  Chapter  is  a  practical  explanation  of  Kåñëa  consciousness, \r\ngenerally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how \r\nkarma-yoga  can  give  liberation  is  answered  herewith.  To  work  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness  is  to  work  with  the  complete  knowledge  of  the  Lord  as  the \r\npredominator.  Such  work  is  not  different  from  transcendental  knowledge. \r\nDirect Kåñëa consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and jïäna-yoga is a path leading to \r\nbhakti-yoga.  Kåñëa  consciousness  means  to  work  in  full  knowledge  of  one’s \r\nrelationship     with    the    Supreme      Absolute,      and    the   perfection     of   this \r\nconsciousness  is  full  knowledge  of  Kåñëa,  or  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead.

He comes into contact with mäyä (illusion) due to the desire to lord it \r\nover  mäyä,  and  that  is  the  cause  of  his  many  sufferings.  As  long  as  he  is  in \r\ncontact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. \r\nKåñëa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is \r\nwithin the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by \r\npractice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed \r\nfrom the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything \r\ndepends  on  one’s  practical  performance  of  duties  in  Kåñëa  consciousness, \r\nwhich helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence \r\nof   desire   and   anger.   And   one   who   stands   fast   in   Kåñëa   consciousness, \r\ncontrolling      the    abovementioned         passions,    remains      factually    in    the \r\ntranscendental  stage,  or  brahma-nirväëa.  The  eightfold  yoga  mysticism  is \r\nautomatically practiced in Kåñëa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is \r\nserved. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, \r\näsana,  präëäyäma,  pratyähära,  dhäraëä,  dhyäna  and  samädhi.  But  these  only \r\npreface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the \r\nhuman being. It is the highest perfection of life."

The parts of the body work \r\nfor  the  satisfaction  of  the  whole  body.  The  limbs  of  the  body  do  not  act  for \r\nself-satisfaction but for the satisfaction  of the complete whole. Similarly, the \r\nliving  entity  who  acts  for  satisfaction  of  the  supreme  whole  and  not  for \r\npersonal satisfaction is the perfect sannyäsé, the perfect yogi. \r\n    The sannyäsés sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated \r\nfrom all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform  agnihotra yajïas \r\n(fire  sacrifices),  but  actually  they  are  self-interested  because  their  goal  is  to \r\nbecome one with the  impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any \r\nmaterial  desire,  but  it  is  not  without  self-interest.  Similarly,  the  mystic  yogé \r\nwho  practices  the  yoga  system  with  half-open  eyes,  ceasing  all  material \r\nactivities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in \r\nKåñëa     consciousness      works     for   the   satisfaction     of  the    whole,    without \r\nself-interest. A Kåñëa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His \r\ncriterion  of  success  is  the  satisfaction  of  Kåñëa,  and  thus  he  is  the  perfect \r\nsannyäsé,  or  perfect  yogé.

One  who  is  not \r\nself-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. \r\nTherefore,  in  the  Båhan-näradéya  Puräëa  it  is  said  that  in  Kali-yuga  (the \r\npresent yuga, or age), when people in general  are short-lived, slow in spiritual \r\nrealization  and  always  disturbed  by  various  anxieties,  the  best  means  of \r\nspiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord."

Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood, when one has \r\nno knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, \r\nor the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the \r\nstrict discipline of becoming  brahmacärés. Without such practice, no one can \r\nmake  advancement  in  any  yoga,  whether  it  be  dhyäna,  jïäna  or  bhakti.  One \r\nwho, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual \r\nrelationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a \r\nbrahmacäré. Such a restrained householder  brahmacäré may be accepted in the \r\nbhakti school, but the jïäna and dhyäna schools do not even admit householder \r\nbrahmacärés.  They  require  complete  abstinence  without  compromise.  In  the \r\nbhakti school, a householder  brahmacäré is allowed controlled sex life because \r\nthe  cult  of  bhakti-yoga  is  so  powerful  that  one  automatically  loses  sexual \r\nattraction,   being   engaged   in   the   superior   service   of   the   Lord.

Yoga practice \r\nis  not  meant  for  attaining  any  kind  of  material  facility;  it  is  to  enable  the \r\ncessation of all material existence.  One who seeks an improvement in health \r\nor aspires after material perfection is no  yogé according to  Bhagavad-gétä. Nor \r\ndoes  cessation  of  material  existence  entail  one’s  entering  into  “the  void,” \r\nwhich is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the \r\nLord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the \r\nspiritual  sky,  the  abode  of  the  Lord.  The  abode  of  the  Lord  is  also  clearly \r\ndescribed  in  the  Bhagavad-gétä  as  that  place  where  there  is  no  need  of  sun, \r\nmoon      or   electricity.    All   the    planets    in   the    spiritual    kingdom      are \r\nself-illuminated  like  the  sun  in  the  material  sky.  The  kingdom  of  God  is \r\neverywhere,  but  the  spiritual  sky  and  the  planets  thereof  are  called  paraà \r\ndhäma, or superior abodes. \r\n    A  consummate  yogé,  who  is  perfect  in  understanding  Lord  Kåñëa,  as  is \r\nclearly    stated    herein     by    the    Lord     Himself      (mat-cittaù,     mat-paraù, \r\nmat-sthänam),  can  attain  real  peace  and  can  ultimately  reach  His  supreme \r\nabode, Kåñëaloka, known as Goloka Våndävana. In the Brahma-saàhitä (5.37) \r\nit  is  clearly  stated,  goloka  eva  nivasaty  akhilätma-bhütaù:  the  Lord,  although \r\nresiding always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and \r\nthe localized Paramätmä as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies.

Therefore,  those  who  indulge  in  animal  food, \r\ndrinking,  smoking  and  eating  food  which  is  not  first  offered  to  Kåñëa  will \r\nsuffer  sinful  reactions  because  of  eating  only  polluted  things.

Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his \r\nown  personal  process  of  fasting,  practice  yoga.  The  Kåñëa  conscious  person \r\nobserves fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat \r\nmore than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One \r\nwho eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must \r\nconsequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six \r\nhours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly \r\ninfluenced  by  the  mode  of  ignorance.  A  person  in  the  mode  of  ignorance  is \r\nlazy and prone to sleep a great deal.

All Rights Reserved. \r\n﻿    By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. \r\nThis  is  the  primary  characteristic  of  the  yoga  principle.  And  after  this,  one \r\nbecomes situated in trance, or samädhi, which means that the  yogé realizes the \r\nSupersoul  through  transcendental  mind  and  intelligence,  without  any  of  the \r\nmisgivings of identifying the self with the Superself.  Yoga practice is more or \r\nless  based  on  the  principles  of  the  Pataïjali  system.  Some  unauthorized \r\ncommentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the \r\nmonists  think  this  to  be  liberation,  but  they  do  not  understand  the  real \r\npurpose     of   the    Pataïjali    system     of   yoga.   There     is  an    acceptance      of \r\ntranscendental pleasure in the Pataïjali system, but the monists do not accept \r\nthis transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. \r\nThe duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in \r\nthis    verse     transcendental         pleasure—realized         through       transcendental \r\nsenses—is  accepted.  And  this  is  corroborated  by  Pataïjali  Muni,  the  famous \r\nexponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-sütras (3.34): \r\npuruñärtha-çünyänäà  guëänäà  pratiprasavaù  kaivalyaà  svarüpa-pratiñöhä  vä \r\nciti-çaktir iti. \r\n    This  citi-çakti,  or  internal  potency,  is  transcendental.  Puruñärtha  means \r\nmaterial religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, \r\nthe   attempt   to   become   one   with   the  Supreme.  This  “oneness  with  the \r\nSupreme”  is  called  kaivalyam  by  the  monist.  But  according  to  Pataïjali,  this \r\nkaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity \r\nbecomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, \r\nthis  state  of  affairs  is  called  ceto-darpaëa-märjanam  [Cc.  Antya  20.12],  or \r\nclearance  of  the  impure  mirror  of  the  mind.  This  “clearance”  is  actually \r\nliberation,  or  bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëam.  The  theory  of  nirväëa—also \r\npreliminary—corresponds with this principle. In the Bhägavatam (2.10.6) this \r\nis called svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù. The  Bhagavad-gétä also confirms this situation \r\nin this verse. \r\n    After  nirväëa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual \r\nactivities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as Kåñëa consciousness. In \r\nthe words of the Bhägavatam, svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù: this is the “real life of the \r\nliving entity.” Mäyä, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated"

Liberation from this material infection does not mean \r\ndestruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pataïjali also \r\naccepts  this  by  his  words  kaivalyaà  svarüpa-pratiñöhä  vä  citi-çaktir  iti.  This \r\nciti-çakti,  or  transcendental  pleasure,  is  real  life.  This  is  confirmed  in  the \r\nVedänta-sütra  (1.1.12)  as  änanda-mayo  ’bhyäsät.  This  natural  transcendental \r\npleasure  is  the  ultimate  goal  of  yoga  and  is  easily  achieved  by  execution  of \r\ndevotional service, or  bhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga will be vividly described in the \r\nSeventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. \r\n    In  the  yoga  system,  as  described  in  this  chapter,  there  are  two  kinds  of \r\nsamädhi,  called  samprajïäta-samädhi  and  asamprajïäta-samädhi.  When  one \r\nbecomes  situated  in  the  transcendental  position  by  various  philosophical \r\nresearches,     he    is  said    to   have    achieved      samprajïäta-samädhi.         In    the \r\nasamprajïäta-samädhi   there   is   no   longer   any   connection   with   mundane \r\npleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from \r\nthe senses. When the yogé is once situated in that transcendental position, he \r\nis  never  shaken  from  it.  Unless  the  yogé  is  able  to  reach  this  position,  he  is \r\nunsuccessful.  Today’s  so-called  yoga  practice,  which  involves  various  sense \r\npleasures,  is  contradictory.  A  yogé  indulging  in  sex  and  intoxication  is  a \r\nmockery. Even those yogés who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the \r\nprocess  of  yoga  are  not  perfectly  situated.  If   yogés  are  attracted  by  the \r\nby-products  of  yoga,  then  they  cannot  attain  the  stage  of  perfection,  as  is \r\nstated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of \r\ngymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way. \r\n    The best practice of  yoga in this age is Kåñëa consciousness, which is not \r\nbaffling. A Kåñëa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does \r\nnot aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially \r\nin this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haöha-yoga, dhyäna-yoga and jïäna-yoga, \r\nbut there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga. \r\n    As  long  as  the  material  body  exists,  one  has  to  meet  the  demands  of  the \r\nbody, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in \r\npure  bhakti-yoga, or in Kåñëa consciousness, does not arouse the senses while \r\nmeeting  the  demands  of  the  body.  Rather,  he  accepts  the  bare  necessities  of \r\nlife, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness"

A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of \r\nthe ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow \r\nbecame very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs.

She \r\nbegan to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for \r\nher  impossible  determination.  The  news  of  her  activity  spread,  and  at  last \r\nGaruòa,   the   gigantic   bird   carrier   of   Lord   Viñëu,   heard   it.   He   became \r\ncompassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. \r\nGaruòa  was  very  pleased  by  the  determination  of  the  small  sparrow,  and  he \r\npromised to help. Thus Garuòa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest \r\nhe himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, \r\nand returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuòa."

The living \r\nentity,  although  part  of  the  superior  energy,  is  conditioned  by  the  inferior \r\nenergy; the living entity is always in the Lord’s energy.

While in the material energy, the \r\nliving entity serves the material senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves \r\nthe  Supreme  Lord  directly.  In  either  case  the  living  entity  is  the  servant  of \r\nGod. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in Kåñëa consciousness."

Kåñëa  in  this  form  of  Supersoul  is  situated  in  everyone’s  heart. \r\nFurthermore,  there  is  no  difference  between  the  innumerable  Supersouls \r\npresent in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference \r\nbetween a Kåñëa conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving \r\nservice  of  Kåñëa  and  a  perfect  yogé  engaged  in  meditation  on  the  Supersoul. \r\nThe yogé in Kåñëa consciousness—even though he may be engaged in various \r\nactivities while in material existence—remains always situated in Kåñëa. This \r\nis  confirmed  in  the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.2.187)  of  Çréla  Rüpa  Gosvämé: \r\nnikhiläsv apy avasthäsu jévan-muktaù sa ucyate. A devotee of the Lord, always \r\nacting     in    Kåñëa     consciousness,       is   automatically       liberated.     In    the \r\nNärada-païcarätra this is confirmed in this way:"

One may argue that by Kåñëa consciousness one may attain the \r\nhighest  perfection  if  it  is  completed,  but  if  one  does  not  attain  such  a \r\nperfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined \r\nin  the  scriptures  that  one  has  to  suffer  the  reaction  for  not  executing \r\nprescribed     duties;    therefore    one    who     fails  to   discharge     transcendental \r\nactivities  properly  becomes  subjected  to  these  reactions.  The  Bhägavatam \r\nassures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even \r\nthough  he  may  be  subjected  to  the  reaction  for  not  perfectly  executing \r\nprescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kåñëa consciousness \r\nis  never  forgotten,  and  one  so  engaged  will  continue  to  be  so  even  if  he  is \r\nlowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly \r\nthe  prescribed  duties  need  not  necessarily  attain  auspicious  results  if  he  is \r\nlacking in Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    The purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into \r\ntwo  sections,  namely,  the  regulated  and  the  nonregulated.  Those  who  are \r\nengaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next \r\nlife or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who \r\nfollow  the  principles  of  prescribed  duties  in  the  scriptures  are  classified \r\namongst  the  regulated  section.  The  nonregulated  section,  both  civilized  and \r\nnoncivilized,  educated  and  noneducated,  strong  and  weak,  are  full  of  animal \r\npropensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the \r\nanimal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually \r\nremain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, \r\nthose who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually \r\nto Kåñëa consciousness, certainly progress in life. \r\n    Those  who  are  following  the  path  of  auspiciousness  can  be  divided  into \r\nthree sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who \r\nare  enjoying  material  prosperity,  (2)  those  who  are  trying  to  find  ultimate \r\nliberation  from  material  existence,  and  (3)  those  who  are  devotees  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness.  Those  who  are  following  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the \r\nscriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those \r\nwho are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. \r\nThose who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a"

The  only  auspicious  activities  are  those  which  lead  one  to  liberation. \r\nAny activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from \r\nthe  material  bodily  concept  of  life  is  not at all auspicious. Activity in Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness  is  the  only  auspicious  activity,  and  anyone  who  voluntarily \r\naccepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of \r\nKåñëa  consciousness  can  be  called  a  perfect  transcendentalist  under  severe \r\nausterity.  And  because  the  eightfold  yoga  system  is  directed  toward  the \r\nultimate  realization  of  Kåñëa  consciousness,  such  practice  is  also  auspicious, \r\nand no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation."

The  English  word  “worship” \r\ncannot be used in the same sense as bhaj. Worship means to adore, or to show \r\nrespect  and  honor  to  the  worthy  one.  But  service  with  love  and  faith  is \r\nespecially  meant  for  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  One  can  avoid \r\nworshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but \r\none   cannot   avoid   serving   the   Supreme   Lord   without   being   thoroughly \r\ncondemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality \r\nof  Godhead,  and  thus  every  living  entity  is  intended  to  serve  the  Supreme \r\nLord   by   his   own   constitution.   Failing   to   do   this,   he   falls   down.   The \r\nBhägavatam (11.5.3) confirms this as follows:"

Therefore,  bhajanti is applicable \r\nto  the  Supreme  Lord  only,  whereas  the  word  “worship”  can  be  applied  to \r\ndemigods or to any other common living entity. The word avajänanti, used in \r\nthis verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-gétä. Avajänanti \r\nmäà müòhäù: “Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead,       Lord    Kåñëa.”    Such     fools   take    it  upon     themselves      to  write \r\ncommentaries on the Bhagavad-gétä without an attitude of service to the Lord. \r\nConsequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and \r\nthe word “worship.” \r\n    The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in  bhakti yoga. All other \r\nyogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually \r\nmeans  bhakti-yoga; all other  yogas are progressions toward the destination of \r\nbhakti-yoga. From the beginning of  karma-yoga to the end of  bhakti-yoga is a \r\nlong   way   to   self-realization.   Karma-yoga,   without   fruitive   results,   is   the \r\nbeginning   of   this   path.   When   karma-yoga   increases   in   knowledge   and \r\nrenunciation,  the  stage  is  called  jïäna-yoga.  When  jïäna -yoga  increases  in \r\nmeditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is \r\non  Him,  it  is  called  añöäìga-yoga.  And  when  one  surpasses  the  añöäìga-yoga \r\nand  comes  to  the  point  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  Kåñëa,  it  is \r\ncalled bhakti yoga, the culmination. Factually,  bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, \r\nbut to analyze  bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other  yogas. \r\nThe  yogé  who  is  progressive  is  therefore  on  the  true  path  of  eternal  good \r\nfortune.  One  who  sticks  to  a  particular  point  and  does  not  make  further \r\nprogress     is  called    by   that    particular    name:     karma-yogé,      jïäna-yogé     or \r\ndhyäna-yogé, räja-yogé, haöha-yogé, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the \r\npoint of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas. \r\nTherefore,  to  become  Kåñëa  conscious  is  the  highest  stage  of  yoga,  just  as, \r\nwhen  we  speak  of  Himälayan,  we  refer  to  the  world’s  highest  mountains,  of"

Kåñëa  is  full  in  all  opulences,  and  how  He \r\nmanifests  such  opulences  is  described  herein.  Also,  four  kinds  of  fortunate \r\npeople  who  become  attached  to  Kåñëa  and  four  kinds  of  unfortunate  people \r\nwho never take to Kåñëa are described in this chapter. \r\n    In  the  first  six  chapters  of  Bhagavad-gétä,  the  living  entity  has  been \r\ndescribed     as   nonmaterial      spirit   soul    capable    of   elevating     himself    to \r\nself-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it \r\nhas been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa, \r\nor  in  other  words  Kåñëa  consciousness,  is  the  highest  form  of  all  yoga.  By \r\nconcentrating one’s mind upon Kåñëa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth \r\ncompletely, but not otherwise. Impersonal  brahmajyoti or localized Paramätmä \r\nrealization  is  not  perfect  knowledge  of  the  Absolute  Truth,  because  it  is \r\npartial. Full and scientific knowledge is Kåñëa, and everything is revealed to \r\nthe  person  in  Kåñëa  consciousness.  In  complete  Kåñëa  consciousness  one \r\nknows that Kåñëa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of \r\nyoga  are  only  steppingstones  on  the  path  of  Kåñëa  consciousness.  One  who \r\ntakes  directly  to  Kåñëa  consciousness  automatically  knows  about  brahmajyoti \r\nand Paramätmä in full. By practice of Kåñëa consciousness yoga, one can know \r\neverything   in   full—namely   the   Absolute   Truth,   the   living   entities,   the \r\nmaterial nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia. \r\n    One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the \r\nSixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa the Supreme is made \r\npossible  by  prescribed  devotional  service  in  nine  different  forms,  of  which \r\nçravaëam is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, \r\ntac chåëu, or “Hear from Me.” No one can  be a greater authority than Kåñëa, \r\nand  therefore  by  hearing  from  Him  one  receives  the  greatest  opportunity  to \r\nbecome a perfectly Kåñëa conscious person. One has therefore to learn from"

Generally mankind is \r\nsimply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending \r\nand mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The \r\nfirst  six  chapters  of  the  Gétä  are  meant  for  those  who  are  interested  in \r\ntranscendental  knowledge,  in  understanding  the  self,  the  Superself  and  the \r\nprocess of realization by jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga and discrimination of the self \r\nfrom matter. However, Kåñëa can be known only by persons who are in Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness.  Other  transcendentalists  may  achieve  impersonal  Brahman \r\nrealization, for this is easier than understanding Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the Supreme \r\nPerson,  but  at  the  same  time  He  is  beyond  the  knowledge  of  Brahman  and \r\nParamätmä. The yogés and jïänés are confused in their attempts to understand \r\nKåñëa. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, has \r\nadmitted  in  his  Gétä  commentary  that  Kåñëa  is  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead, his followers do not accept Kåñëa as such, for it is very difficult to \r\nknow  Kåñëa,  even  though  one  has  transcendental  realization  of  impersonal \r\nBrahman. \r\n    Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the \r\nprimeval   Lord   Govinda.

Although  nondevotees  declare  that  the  path  of \r\nbhakti, or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of \r\nbhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they \r\ntake up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy.

The  second,  Garbhodakaçäyé  Viñëu,  enters  into  all  the \r\nuniverses to create diversities in each of them. The third, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, \r\nis diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as \r\nParamätmä.  He  is  present  even  within  the  atoms.  Anyone  who  knows  these \r\nthree Viñëus can be liberated from material entanglement.” \r\n    This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of \r\nthe Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three \r\nViñëu  expansions  of  Lord  Kåñëa.  These  puruñas  are  called  incarnations. \r\nGenerally  one  who  does  not  know  the  science  of  God  (Kåñëa)  assumes  that \r\nthis  material  world  is  for  the  enjoyment  of  the  living  entities  and  that  the \r\nliving  entities  are  the  puruñas—the  causes,  controllers  and  enjoyers  of  the \r\nmaterial energy. According to  Bhagavad-gétä this atheistic conclusion is false. \r\nIn the verse under discussion it is stated that Kåñëa is the original cause of the \r\nmaterial manifestation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam also confirms this. The ingredients \r\nof  the  material  manifestation  are  separated  energies  of  the  Lord.  Even  the \r\nbrahmajyoti,  which  is  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  impersonalists,  is  a  spiritual \r\nenergy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the \r\nbrahmajyoti as there are in the Vaikuëöhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts \r\nthis  brahmajyoti as  the ultimate eternal goal. The Paramätmä manifestation is \r\nalso   a   temporary   all-pervasive   aspect   of   the   Kñérodakaçäyé   Viñëu.   The \r\nParamätmä manifestation is not eternal  in the spiritual world. Therefore the \r\nfactual  Absolute  Truth  is  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  Kåñëa.  He  is \r\nthe  complete  energetic  person,  and  He  possesses  different  separated  and \r\ninternal energies. \r\n    In  the  material  energy,  the  principal  manifestations  are  eight,  as  above \r\nmentioned.  Out  of  these,  the  first  five  manifestations,  namely  earth,  water, \r\nfire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, \r\nwithin which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations \r\nof  physical  sound,  touch,  form,  taste  and  smell.  Material  science  comprises \r\nthese  ten  items  and  nothing  more.  But  the  other  three  items,  namely  mind,"

Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, \r\netc.)  and  subtle  (mind,  etc.),  are  products  of  the  inferior  energy.  The  living \r\nentities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are \r\nthe superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the \r\nentire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act \r\nunless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always \r\ncontrolled  by  the  energetic,  and  therefore  the  living  entities  are  always \r\ncontrolled by the Lord—they have no independent existence. They are never \r\nequally  powerful,  as  unintelligent  men  think.  The  distinction  between  the \r\nliving  entities  and  the  Lord  is  described  in  Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.87.30)  as \r\nfollows:"

These living entities are His superior energy because the \r\nquality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are \r\nnever equal to the Lord  in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and \r\nsubtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets \r\nhis  real  spiritual  mind  and  intelligence.  This  forgetfulness  is  due  to  the \r\ninfluence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes \r\nfree  from  the  influence  of  the  illusory  material  energy,  he  attains  the  stage \r\ncalled  mukti,  or  liberation.  The  false  ego,  under  the  influence  of  material \r\nillusion, thinks, “I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.” His actual \r\nposition is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the \r\nconception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may \r\nconclude  that  the  Gétä  confirms  the  living  entity  to  be  only  one  of  the \r\nmulti-energies   of   Kåñëa;   and   when   this   energy   is   freed   from   material \r\ncontamination, it becomes fully Kåñëa conscious, or liberated."

This   material   body   is \r\ndeveloped  because  spirit  is  present  within  matter;  a  child  grows  gradually  to \r\nboyhood  and  then  to  manhood  because  that  superior  energy,  spirit  soul,  is \r\npresent. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is \r\ndeveloped  because  of  the  presence  of  the  Supersoul,  Viñëu.  Therefore  spirit \r\nand  matter,  which  combine  to  manifest  this  gigantic  universal  form,  are \r\noriginally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original \r\ncause  of  everything.  A  fragmental  part  and  parcel  of  the  Lord,  namely  the \r\nliving entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big \r\ncity, but he cannot be the cause of a big universe.

As far as  Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, the Absolute \r\nTruth is the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, and this is confirmed in every \r\nstep.  In  this  verse,  in  particular,  it  is  stressed  that  the  Absolute  Truth  is  a \r\nperson. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also \r\nthe    affirmation      of   the     Brahma-saàhitä:        éçvaraù    paramaù      kåñëaù \r\nsac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù;  that  is,  the  Supreme  Absolute  Truth  Personality  of \r\nGodhead is Lord Kåñëa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, \r\nGovinda,  and  the  eternal  form  of  complete  bliss  and  knowledge.  These \r\nauthorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the \r\ncause of all causes.

Consequently, his release from the clutches of \r\nmaterial  nature  is  very  difficult,  even  though  that  material  nature  is  an \r\ninferior   energy,   because   material   energy   is   ultimately   conducted   by   the \r\nsupreme  will,  which  the  living  entity  cannot  overcome.  Inferior,  material \r\nnature  is  defined  herein  as  divine  nature  due  to  its  divine  connection  and \r\nmovement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, \r\nalthough inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of \r\nthe  cosmic  manifestation.  The  Vedas  confirm  this  as  follows:   mäyäà  tu \r\nprakåtià vidyän mäyinaà tu maheçvaram. “Although  mäyä [illusion] is false or \r\ntemporary, the background of mäyä is the supreme magician, the Personality of"

A man bound by the \r\nhands  and  feet  cannot  free  himself—he  must  be  helped  by  a  person  who  is \r\nunbound.  Because  the  bound  cannot  help  the  bound,  the  rescuer  must  be \r\nliberated.  Therefore,  only  Lord  Kåñëa,  or  His  bona  fide  representative  the \r\nspiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, \r\none cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, \r\nor Kåñëa consciousness, can help one gain such release. Kåñëa, being the Lord \r\nof   illusory   energy,   can   order   this   insurmountable   energy   to   release   the \r\nconditioned  soul.  He  orders  this  release  out  of  His  causeless  mercy  on  the \r\nsurrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is \r\noriginally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of \r\nthe  Lord  is  the  only  means  to  get  free  from  the  clutches  of  the  stringent \r\nmaterial nature. \r\n    The  words  mäm  eva  are  also  significant.  Mäm  means  unto  Kåñëa  (Viñëu) \r\nonly, and not Brahmä or Çiva. Although Brahmä and Çiva are greatly elevated \r\nand are almost on the level of Viñëu, it is not possible for such incarnations of \r\nrajo-guëa (passion) and tamo-guëa (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul \r\nfrom  the  clutches  of  mäyä.  In  other  words,  both  Brahmä  and  Çiva  are  also \r\nunder the influence of mäyä. Only Viñëu is the master of  mäyä; therefore He \r\nalone  can  give  release  to  the  conditioned  soul.  The  Vedas   (Çvetäçvatara \r\nUpaniñad  3.8)  confirm  this  in  the  phrase  tam  eva  viditvä.  or  “Freedom  is \r\npossible only by understanding Kåñëa.” Even Lord Çiva affirms that liberation \r\ncan  be  achieved  only  by  the  mercy  of  Viñëu.  Lord  Çiva  says,  mukti-pradätä \r\nsarveñäà viñëur eva na saàçayaù: “There is no doubt that Viñëu is the deliverer \r\nof liberation for everyone.”"

Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, \r\neducators,  administrators,  etc.,  but  who  pose  themselves  as  such  for  material \r\ngain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea \r\nof  God;  they  simply  manufacture  their  own  worldly  plans  and  consequently \r\ncomplicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve \r\nthem.  Because  material  energy  (nature)  is  so  powerful,  it  can  resist  the \r\nunauthorized  plans  of  the  atheists  and  baffle  the  knowledge  of  “planning \r\ncommissions.” \r\n    The  atheistic  planmakers  are  described  herein  by  the  word  duñkåtinaù,  or \r\n“miscreants.” Kåté means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist \r\nplanmaker  is  sometimes  very  intelligent  and  meritorious  also,  because  any \r\ngigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the \r\natheist’s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, \r\nthe atheistic planmaker is called duñkåté. which indicates that his intelligence \r\nand efforts are misdirected. \r\n    In the  Gétä it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under \r\nthe direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works \r\nas  the  shadow  moves,  in  accordance  with  the  movements  of  the  object.  But \r\nstill  material  energy  is  very  powerful,  and  the  atheist,  due  to  his  godless \r\ntemperament,  cannot  know  how  it  works;  nor  can  he  know  the  plan  of  the \r\nSupreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his \r\nplans  are  baffled,  as  in  the  case  of  Hiraëyakaçipu  and  Rävaëa,  whose  plans \r\nwere smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, \r\nphilosophers,  administrators  and  educators.  These  duñkåtinas,  or  miscreants, \r\nare of four different patterns, as outlined below. \r\n    (1) The müòhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of \r\nburden. They want to enjoy the fruits  of their labor by themselves, and so do \r\nnot want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast \r\nof  burden  is  the  ass.  This  humble  beast  is  made  to  work  very  hard  by  his"

The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. \r\nHe remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a \r\nwhile under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite \r\nat  the  risk  of  being  repeatedly  kicked  by  the  opposite  party.  The  ass  sings \r\npoetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. \r\nThis is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom \r\nhe  should  work.  He  does  not  know  that  karma  (action)  is  meant  for  yajïa \r\n(sacrifice). \r\n    Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of \r\nself-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the \r\nliving being. To such  müòhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life’s \r\nall in all—despite the fact that the müòhas enjoy only a very small fraction of \r\nthe fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive \r\ngain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with \r\npractically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for \r\nthe  benefit  of  illusory  masters.  Ignorant  of  their  real  master,  the  foolish \r\nworkers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never \r\nsurrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of \r\nHim from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to \r\naccept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will \r\nuntiringly  continue  to  hear  of  the  sense-enjoyable  tidings  of  the  flickering \r\nmundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living \r\nforce that moves the material world. \r\n    (2) Another class of duñkåté, or miscreant, is called the  narädhama, or the \r\nlowest of mankind.  Nara means human being, and  adhama means the lowest. \r\nOut  of  the  8,400,000  different  species  of  living  beings,  there  are  400,000 \r\nhuman  species.  Out  of  these  there  are  numerous  lower  forms  of  human  life \r\nthat  are  mostly  uncivilized.  The  civilized  human  beings  are  those  who  have \r\nregulative  principles  of  social,  political  and  religious  life.  Those  who  are \r\nsocially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be \r\nconsidered  narädhamas.  Nor  is  religion  without  God  religion,  because  the \r\npurpose  of  following  religious  principles  is  to  know  the  Supreme  Truth  and \r\nman’s relation with Him. In the Gétä the Personality of Godhead clearly states"

The \r\ncivilized form of human life is meant for man’s reviving the lost consciousness of \r\nhis eternal relation with the Supreme  Truth, the Personality of Godhead Çré \r\nKåñëa,  who  is  all-powerful.  Whoever  loses  this  chance  is  classified  as  a \r\nnarädhama. We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is \r\nin the mother’s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God \r\nfor deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To \r\npray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being \r\nbecause he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child \r\nforgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced \r\nby mäyä, the illusory energy. \r\n    It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness \r\ndormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in \r\nthe  Manu-småti.  which  is  the  guide  to  religious  principles,  are  meant  for \r\nreviving God consciousness in the system of  varëäçrama. However, no process \r\nis strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of \r\nthe population is narädhama. \r\n    When   the   whole   population   becomes   narädhama.   naturally   all   their \r\nso-called  education  is  made  null  and  void  by  the  all-powerful  energy  of \r\nphysical  nature.  According  to  the  standard  of  the  Gétä,  a  learned  man  is  he \r\nwho sees on equal terms the learned brähmaëa. the dog. the cow, the elephant \r\nand the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, \r\nwho  is  the  incarnation  of  Godhead  as  divine  master,  delivered  the  typical \r\nnarädhamas. the brothers Jagäi and Mädhäi, and showed how the mercy  of a \r\nreal devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the narädhama who is \r\ncondemned  by  the  Personality  of  Godhead  can  again  revive  his  spiritual \r\nconsciousness only by the mercy of a devotee. \r\n    Çré   Caitanya     Mahäprabhu,        in  propagating      the   bhägavata-dharma,        or \r\nactivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the \r\nmessage  of  the  Personality  of  Godhead.  The  essence  of  this  message  is \r\nBhagavad-gétä.  The  lowest  amongst  human  beings  can  be  delivered  by  this \r\nsubmissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an \r\naural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will"

Narädhamas, or the lowest of mankind, will fully neglect \r\nthe prime duty of the human being. \r\n    (3) The next class of duñkåté is called mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù, or those persons \r\nwhose  erudite  knowledge  has  been  nullified  by  the  influence  of  illusory \r\nmaterial  energy.  They  are  mostly  very  learned  fellows—great  philosophers, \r\npoets,  literati,  scientists,  etc.—but  the  illusory  energy  misguides  them,  and \r\ntherefore they disobey the Supreme Lord. \r\n    There are a great number of  mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù at the present moment, \r\neven  amongst  the  scholars  of  the  Bhagavad-gétä.  In  the  Gétä,  in  plain  and \r\nsimple  language,  it  is  stated  that  Çré  Kåñëa  is  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the \r\nfather of Brahmä, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Çré Kåñëa is \r\nsaid to be not only the father of Brahmä but also the father of all species of life. \r\nHe  is  the  root  of  the  impersonal  Brahman  and  Paramätmä; the Supersoul in \r\nevery entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and \r\neveryone  is  advised  to  surrender  unto  His  lotus  feet.  Despite  all  these  clear \r\nstatements,  the  mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù  deride  the  personality  of  the  Supreme \r\nLord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that \r\nthe blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental \r\nfeature of the Supreme Lord. \r\n    All   the    unauthorized       interpretations      of   the    Gétä   by    the   class   of \r\nmäyayäpahåta-jïänäù,  outside  the  purview  of  the  paramparä  system,  are  so \r\nmany  stumbling  blocks  on  the  path  of  spiritual  understanding.  The  deluded \r\ninterpreters  do  not  surrender  unto  the  lotus  feet  of  Çré  Kåñëa,  nor  do  they \r\nteach others to follow this principle. \r\n    (4)  The  last  class  of  duñkåté  is  called  äsuraà  bhävam  äçritäù,  or  those  of \r\ndemonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the \r\nSupreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable \r\nto give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him \r\nsubordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the \r\nGétä. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present \r\na number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such \r\npersons,  whose  very  principle  of  life  is  to  decry  the  Personality  of  Godhead,"

In   the   beginning   of   spiritual \r\nrealization,  while  one  is  trying  to  give  up  one’s  attachment  to  materialism, \r\nthere   is   some   leaning   towards   impersonalism,   but   when   one   is   further \r\nadvanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and \r\nthat these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes \r\nattached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him.

He  realizes  the  material  world  to  be  a  perverted \r\nreflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a \r\nrelationship  with  the  Supreme  Lord  Kåñëa.  Thus  he  thinks  of  everything  in \r\nrelation  to  Väsudeva,  or  Çré  Kåñëa.  Such  a  universal  vision  of  Väsudeva \r\nprecipitates one’s full surrender to the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa as the highest \r\ngoal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare. \r\n    This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and 15) \r\nof the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad:"

Therefore      He    gives    everyone      full \r\nindependence—whatever one likes—but His ultimate instruction we find in \r\nthe   Bhagavad-gétä:   one   should   give   up   all   other   engagements   and   fully \r\nsurrender unto Him. That will make man happy. \r\n    Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship \r\nthe demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction \r\nwithout the supreme will. As it  is said, not a blade of grass moves without the \r\nwill  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  Generally,  persons  who  are \r\ndistressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the \r\nVedic  literature.  A  person  wanting  some  particular  thing  may  worship  such \r\nand  such  a  demigod.  For  example,  a  diseased  person  is  recommended  to \r\nworship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of \r\nlearning,  Sarasvaté;  and  a  person  wanting  a  beautiful  wife  may  worship  the \r\ngoddess Umä, the wife of Lord Çiva. In this way there are recommendations in \r\nthe  çästras  (Vedic  scriptures)  for  different  modes  of  worship  of  different \r\ndemigods.  And  because  a  particular  living  entity  wants  to  enjoy  a  particular \r\nmaterial  facility,  the  Lord  inspires  him  with  a  strong  desire  to  achieve  that \r\nbenediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the \r\nbenediction.  The  particular  mode  of  the  devotional  attitude  of  the  living \r\nentity  toward  a  particular  type  of  demigod  is  also  arranged  by  the  Supreme \r\nLord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but \r\nbecause He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts \r\nof all living entities, Kåñëa gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. \r\nThe demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme \r\nLord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature it is stated: \r\n“The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the \r\nheart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the \r\ndesire  of  the  living  entity.  But  both  the  demigod  and  the  living  entity  are \r\ndependent on the supreme will. They are not independent.”"

Similarly, if anyone \r\nwants  to  worship  a  demigod  like  Indra,  he  can  attain  that  particular  god’s \r\nplanet.  It  is  not  that  everyone,  regardless  of  whatever  demigod  is  worshiped, \r\nwill reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is \r\nclearly  stated  that  the  worshipers  of  demigods  go  to  different  planets  in  the \r\nmaterial  world  but  the  devotee  of  the  Supreme  Lord  goes  directly  to  the \r\nsupreme planet of the Personality of Godhead. \r\n    Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the \r\nbody   of   the   Supreme   Lord,   then   the   same   end   should   be   achieved   by \r\nworshiping  them.  However,  worshipers  of  the  demigods  are  less  intelligent \r\nbecause they don’t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some \r\nof them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways \r\nto supply food. This isn’t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body \r\nthrough the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different \r\nparts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they \r\nbelieve that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the \r\nSupreme Lord. \r\n    Not  only  are  demigods  parts  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  but  ordinary  living \r\nentities are also. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that the  brähmaëas are \r\nthe head of the Supreme Lord, the  kñatriyas are His arms, the  vaiçyas are His \r\nwaist, the  çüdras are His legs, and all serve different functions. Regardless of \r\nthe situation, if one knows that both  the demigods and himself are part and \r\nparcel  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  his  knowledge  is  perfect.  But  if  he  does  not \r\nunderstand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside.

But  those  who \r\nspeculate  to  understand  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  are  unable  to \r\nknow You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.” One \r\ncannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or His form, \r\nquality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. \r\nOne must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in \r\nKåñëa  consciousness,  beginning  by  chanting  the  mahä-mantra—Hare  Kåñëa, \r\nHare  Kåñëa,  Kåñëa  Kåñëa,  Hare  Hare/  Hare  Räma,  Hare  Räma,  Räma  Räma, \r\nHare   Hare—then   only   can   one   understand   the   Supreme   Personality   of \r\nGodhead.

As  stated  in  the  twenty-third  verse,  devän  deva-yajo  yänti \r\nmad-bhaktä yänti mäm api: the worshipers of the demigods go to the different \r\nplanets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord Kåñëa go to the \r\nKåñëaloka  planet.  Although  this  is  clearly  stated,  the  foolish  impersonalists \r\nstill maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. \r\nFrom the study of the  Gétä does it appear that the demigods and their abodes \r\nare   impersonal?   Clearly,   neither   the   demigods   nor   Kåñëa,   the   Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead,  are  impersonal.  They  are  all  persons;  Lord  Kåñëa  is \r\nthe  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  and  He  has  His  own  planet,  and  the \r\ndemigods have theirs. \r\n    Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that \r\nform  is  imposed  does  not  hold  true.  It  is  clearly  stated  here  that  it  is  not \r\nimposed. From the Bhagavad-gétä we can clearly understand that the forms of \r\nthe  demigods  and  the  form  of  the  Supreme  Lord  are  simultaneously  existing \r\nand that Lord Kåñëa is sac-cid-änanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The  Vedas \r\nalso confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät, or by \r\nnature  full  of  blissful  pleasure,  and  that  He  is  the  reservoir  of  unlimited \r\nauspicious  qualities.  And  in  the  Gétä  the  Lord  says  that  although  He  is  aja \r\n(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from \r\nthe  Bhagavad-gétä.  We  cannot  understand  how  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist \r\nis false as far as the statements of the Gétä are concerned. It is clear herein that \r\nthe Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa, has both form and personality."

Anyone  with  a \r\nmaterial body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, \r\nnor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know \r\nwhat  is  happening  in  past,  present  and  future.  Unless  one  is  liberated  from \r\nmaterial contamination, he cannot know past, present and future. \r\n    Unlike   the   ordinary   human   being,   Lord   Kåñëa   clearly   says   that   He \r\ncompletely  knows  what  happened  in  the  past,  what  is  happening  in  the \r\npresent, and what will happen in the future.

Arjuna  is  very \r\nanxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. \r\nWhat should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all \r\nthe bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. \r\nThus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the \r\nSupreme Lord. Mahäräja Kulaçekhara, a great devotee, prays, “My dear Lord, \r\njust now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the \r\nswan  of  my  mind  can  seek  entrance  at  the  stem  of  Your  lotus  feet.”  The \r\nmetaphor  is  used  because  the  swan,  a  bird  of  the  water,  takes  pleasure  in \r\ndigging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower. \r\nMahäräja Kulaçekhara says to the Lord, “Now my mind is undisturbed, and I \r\nam quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am \r\nsure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But \r\nif I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, \r\nbecause at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be \r\nchoked  up,  and  I  do  not  know  whether  I  shall  be  able  to  chant  Your  name. \r\nBetter  let  me  die  immediately.”  Arjuna  questions  how  a  person  can  fix  his \r\nmind on Kåñëa’s lotus feet at such a time."

In material nature he may take a body from any of \r\nthe 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In \r\nmaterial nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast, \r\nbird,  etc.,  according  to  his  karma.  To  attain  material  heavenly  planets  and \r\nenjoy  their  facilities,  he  sometimes  performs  sacrifices  (yajïa),  but  when  his \r\nmerit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process \r\nis called karma. \r\n    The  Chändogya  Upaniñad  describes  the  Vedic  sacrificial  process.  On  the \r\nsacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings are made into five kinds of fire. The five \r\nkinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man \r\nand woman, and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on \r\nthe moon, rain, grains and semen. \r\n    In  the  process  of  sacrifice,  the  living  entity  makes  specific  sacrifices  to \r\nattain  specific  heavenly  planets  and  consequently  reaches  them.  When  the \r\nmerit of sacrifice is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form \r\nof rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and \r\ntransformed  into  semen,  which  impregnates  a  woman,  and  thus  the  living \r\nentity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat \r\nthe same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the \r\nmaterial path. The Kåñëa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He \r\ntakes directly to Kåñëa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to \r\nGodhead. \r\n    Impersonalist  commentators  on  the  Bhagavad-gétä  unreasonably  assume \r\nthat Brahman takes the form of jéva in the material world, and to substantiate \r\nthis they refer to  Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the  Gétä. But in this verse the \r\nLord also speaks of the living entity as “an eternal fragment of Myself.” The \r\nfragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but \r\nthe Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that \r\nthe  Supreme  Brahman  assumes  the  form  of  jéva  is  not  acceptable.  It  is \r\nimportant to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is \r\ndistinguished from Parabrahman (the Supreme Lord)."

This is a point  we should note very carefully. How can \r\none  die  in  the  proper  state  of  mind?  Mahäräja  Bharata,  although  a  great \r\npersonality, thought of a deer  at the end of his life, and so in his next life he \r\nwas transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his \r\npast  activities,  he  had  to  accept  that  animal  body.  Of  course,  one’s  thoughts \r\nduring the course of one’s life accumulate to influence one’s thoughts at the \r\nmoment of death, so this life creates one’s next life. If in one’s present life one \r\nlives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of Kåñëa, it is possible for one \r\nto remember Kåñëa at the end of one’s life. That will help one be transferred to \r\nthe  transcendental  nature  of  Kåñëa.  If  one  is  transcendentally  absorbed  in \r\nKåñëa’s  service,  then  his  next  body  will  be  transcendental  (spiritual),  not \r\nmaterial.

One cannot meditate on \r\nsomething impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of \r\nKåñëa, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord \r\nis puruña, a person—we think of the person  Räma and the person Kåñëa. And \r\nwhether one thinks of Räma or of Kåñëa, what He is like is described in this \r\nverse of  Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord is  kavi; that is,  He knows past, present and \r\nfuture and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He \r\nis  the  origin  of  everything;  everything  is  born  out  of  Him.  He  is  also  the \r\nsupreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of \r\nhumanity.     He    is  smaller    than   the   smallest.

One \r\ncannot  suddenly  remember  the  Supreme  Lord  at  death;  one  must  have \r\npracticed  some  yoga  system,  especially  the  system  of  bhakti-yoga.  Since  one’s \r\nmind  at  death  is  very  disturbed,  one  should  practice  transcendence  through \r\nyoga during one’s life."

The Lord says that Brahman, although one \r\nwithout  a  second,  has  various  manifestations  and  features.

Previous     verses   have     mentioned      four    different    kinds    of \r\ndevotees—the  distressed,  the  inquisitive,  those  who  seek  material  gain,  and \r\nthe speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been \r\ndescribed: karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and haöha-yoga. The principles of these yoga \r\nsystems  have  some  bhakti  added,  but  this  verse  particularly  mentions  pure \r\nbhakti-yoga, without any mixture of jïäna, karma or haöha. As indicated by the \r\nword ananya-cetäù, in pure  bhakti-yoga the devotee desires nothing but Kåñëa. \r\nA  pure  devotee  does  not  desire  promotion  to  heavenly  planets,  nor  does  he \r\nseek  oneness  with  the  brahmajyoti  or  salvation  or  liberation  from  material \r\nentanglement.        A    pure    devotee     does     not    desire    anything.     In    the \r\nCaitanya-caritämåta  the  pure  devotee  is  called  niñkäma,  which  means  he  has \r\nno desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who \r\nstrive for personal gain. Whereas a jïäna-yogé, karma-yogé or haöha-yogé has his \r\nown selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who \r\nis unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain. \r\n    A pure devotee always engages in devotional service to Kåñëa in one of His \r\nvarious    personal     features.    Kåñëa    has    various    plenary     expansions     and \r\nincarnations, such as Räma and Nåsiàha, and a devotee can choose to fix his \r\nmind  in  loving  service  to  any  of  these  transcendental  forms  of  the  Supreme \r\nLord.  Such  a  devotee  meets  with  none  of  the  problems  that  plague  the \r\npractitioners  of  other  yogas.  Bhakti-yoga  is  very  simple  and  pure  and  easy  to \r\nperform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare Kåñëa. The Lord is merciful"

The  Lord  helps  such  devotees  in \r\nvarious ways. As stated in the Vedas (Kaöha Upaniñad 1.2.23), yam evaiña våëute \r\ntena labhyas/ tasyaiña ätmä vivåëute tanuà sväm: one who is fully surrendered \r\nand  engaged  in  the  devotional  service  of  the  Supreme  Lord  can  understand \r\nthe  Supreme  Lord  as  He  is.  And  as  stated  in  Bhagavad-gétä  (10.10),  dadämi \r\nbuddhi-yogaà tam: the Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that \r\nultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom. \r\n    The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of \r\nKåñëa  without  deviation  and  without  considering  the  time  or  place.  There \r\nshould be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere \r\nand at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like \r\nVåndävana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can \r\nlive  anywhere  and  create  the  atmosphere  of  Våndävana  by  his  devotional \r\nservice.  It  was  Çré  Advaita  who  told  Lord  Caitanya,  “Wherever  You  are,  O \r\nLord—there is Våndävana.” \r\n    As  indicated  by  the  words  satatam  and  nityaçaù,  which  mean  “always,” \r\n“regularly,”  or  “every  day,”  a  pure  devotee  constantly  remembers  Kåñëa  and \r\nmeditates  upon  Him.  These  are  qualifications  of  the  pure  devotee  for  whom \r\nthe  Lord  is  most  easily  attainable.  Bhakti-yoga  is  the  system  that  the  Gétä \r\nrecommends above all others. Generally, the  bhakti-yogés are engaged in five \r\ndifferent  ways:  (1)  çänta-bhakta,  engaged  in  devotional  service  in  neutrality; \r\n(2) däsya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) säkhya-bhakta, \r\nengaged      as   friend;    (4)   vätsalya-bhakta,      engaged      as   parent;     and    (5) \r\nmädhurya-bhakta,  engaged  as  conjugal  lover  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  In  any  of \r\nthese    ways,    the    pure    devotee     is   always    constantly      engaged      in   the \r\ntranscendental  loving  service  of  the  Supreme  Lord  and  cannot  forget  the \r\nSupreme  Lord,  and  so  for  him  the  Lord  is  easily  attained.  A  pure  devotee \r\ncannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord \r\ncannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the \r\nKåñëa  conscious  process  of  chanting  the  mahä-mantra—Hare  Kåñëa,  Hare \r\nKåñëa,  Kåñëa  Kåñëa,  Hare  Hare/  Hare  Räma,  Hare  Räma,  Räma  Räma,  Hare \r\nHare."

There  are  also  trees,  called  “desire  trees,”  that \r\nsupply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows, known as surabhi \r\ncows, which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served \r\nby hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lakñmés), and He is called \r\nGovinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed \r\nto  blow  His  flute  (veëuà  kvaëantam).  His  transcendental  form  is  the  most \r\nattractive in all the worlds—His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His \r\nbody is like the color of clouds. He is  so attractive that His beauty excels that \r\nof thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and \r\na  peacock  feather  in  His  hair.  In  the  Bhagavad-gétä  Lord  Kåñëa  gives  only  a \r\nsmall hint of His personal abode, Goloka Våndävana, which is the supermost \r\nplanet   in   the   spiritual   kingdom.   A   vivid   description   is   given   in   the \r\nBrahma-saàhitä.  Vedic  literatures  (Kaöha  Upaniñad  1.3.11)  state  that  there  is \r\nnothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is \r\nthe  ultimate  destination  (puruñän  na  paraà  kiïcit  sä  käñöhä  paramä  gatiù ). \r\nWhen  one  attains  to  it,  he  never  returns  to  the  material  world.  Kåñëa’s \r\nsupreme abode and Kåñëa Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. \r\nOn this earth, Våndävana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that \r\nsupreme   Goloka   Våndävana   located   in   the   spiritual   sky.   When   Kåñëa \r\ndescended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as \r\nVåndävana,   comprising   about   eighty-four   square   miles   in   the   district   of \r\nMathurä, India."

One has to \r\nstudy the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many \r\nausterities and penances while living under his care. A brahmacäré has to live \r\nin the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms \r\nfrom door to door and bring them to  the spiritual master. He takes food only \r\nunder the master’s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food \r\nthat  day,  the  student  fasts.  These  are  some  of  the  Vedic  principles  for \r\nobserving brahmacarya. \r\n    After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five \r\nto twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas \r\nis not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation \r\nof  character.  After  this  training,  the  brahmacäré  is  allowed  to  enter  into \r\nhousehold life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many \r\nsacrifices  so  that  he  may  achieve  further  enlightenment.  He  must  also  give \r\ncharity  according  to  the  country,  time  and  candidate,  discriminating  among \r\ncharity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-gétä. \r\nThen   after   retiring   from   household   life,   upon   accepting   the   order   of \r\nvänaprastha,  he  undergoes  severe  penances—living  in  forests,  dressing  with \r\ntree  bark,  not  shaving,  etc.  By  carrying  out  the  orders  of   brahmacarya, \r\nhouseholder  life,  vänaprastha  and  finally  sannyäsa,  one  becomes  elevated  to \r\nthe   perfectional   stage   of   life.   Some   are   then   elevated   to   the   heavenly \r\nkingdoms,  and  when  they  become  even  more  advanced they are liberated in \r\nthe  spiritual  sky,  either  in  the  impersonal  brahmajyoti  or  in  the  Vaikuëöha \r\nplanets or Kåñëaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures. \r\n    The  beauty  of  Kåñëa  consciousness,  however,  is  that  by  one  stroke,  by \r\nengaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different \r\norders of life. \r\n    The    words     idaà     viditvä   indicate     that   one    should     understand       the \r\ninstructions  given  by  Çré  Kåñëa  in  this  chapter  and  the  Seventh  Chapter  of \r\nBhagavad-gétä. One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship \r\nor  mental  speculation  but  by  hearing  them  in  association  with  devotees. \r\nChapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-gétä. The first six \r\nand the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which"

If one is fortunate enough to understand \r\nBhagavad-gétä—especially  these  middle  six  chapters—in  the  association  of \r\ndevotees,   then   his   life   at   once   becomes   glorified   beyond   all   penances, \r\nsacrifices,  charities,  speculations,  etc.,  for  one  can  achieve  all  the  results  of \r\nthese activities simply by Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    One who has a little faith in Bhagavad-gétä should learn Bhagavad-gétä from \r\na devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly \r\nthat  Bhagavad-gétä  can  be  understood  only  by  devotees;  no  one  else  can \r\nperfectly understand the purpose of Bhagavad-gétä. One should therefore learn \r\nBhagavad-gétä from a devotee of Kåñëa, not from mental speculators. This is a \r\nsign  of  faith.  When  one  searches  for  a  devotee  and  finally  gets  a  devotee’s \r\nassociation  one  actually  begins  to  study  and  understand  Bhagavad-gétä.  By \r\nadvancement  in  the  association  of  the  devotee  one  is  placed  in  devotional \r\nservice, and this service dispels all one’s misgivings about Kåñëa, or God, and \r\nKåñëa’s   activities,   form,   pastimes,   name   and   other   features.   After   these \r\nmisgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one’s study. \r\nThen one relishes the study of  Bhagavad-gétä and attains the state of feeling \r\nalways  Kåñëa  conscious.  In  the  advanced  stage,  one  falls  completely  in  love \r\nwith  Kåñëa.  This  highest  perfectional  stage  of  life  enables  the  devotee  to  be \r\ntransferred to Kåñëa’s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka Våndävana, where the \r\ndevotee becomes eternally happy."

Lord Kåñëa, in order to encourage Arjuna  to higher and \r\nhigher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters \r\nmore confidential than any He has already disclosed. \r\n    The very beginning of  Bhagavad-gétä, the First Chapter, is more or less an \r\nintroduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters, \r\nthe spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the \r\nSeventh and Eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and \r\nbecause  they  bring  enlightenment  in  Kåñëa  consciousness,  they  are  called \r\nmore confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter \r\ndeal   with   unalloyed,   pure   devotion.   Therefore   this   is   called   the   most \r\nconfidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of Kåñëa \r\nis naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is \r\nin  the  material  world.  In  the  Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  it  is  said  that  although \r\none who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is \r\nsituated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered \r\nliberated.  Similarly,  we  shall  find  in  the  Bhagavad-gétä,  Tenth  Chapter,  that \r\nanyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person. \r\n    Now this first verse has specific significance. The words idaà jïänam (“this \r\nknowledge”) refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different \r\nactivities:   hearing,   chanting,   remembering,   serving,   worshiping,   praying, \r\nobeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice \r\nof  these  nine  elements  of  devotional  service  one  is  elevated  to  spiritual \r\nconsciousness,  Kåñëa  consciousness.  When  one’s  heart  is  thus  cleared  of \r\nmaterial contamination, one can understand this science of  Kåñëa. Simply to \r\nunderstand that a living entity is not  material is not sufficient. That may be"

Now in Chapter Nine the \r\nglories of the Lord will be delineated. \r\n    The Sanskrit word anasüyave in this verse is also very significant. Generally \r\nthe commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of Kåñëa, \r\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on \r\nBhagavad-gétä  very  inaccurately.  Because  they  are  envious  of  Kåñëa,  their \r\ncommentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are \r\nbona  fide.  No  one  can  explain  Bhagavad-gétä  or  give  perfect  knowledge  of \r\nKåñëa  if  he  is  envious.  One  who  criticizes  the  character  of  Kåñëa  without \r\nknowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. \r\nFor one who understands that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \r\nthe pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial."

Among  the \r\nprincipal  philosophers  in  India  are  Gautama,  Kaëäda,  Kapila,  Yäjïavalkya, \r\nÇäëòilya  and  Vaiçvänara.  And  finally  there  is  Vyäsadeva,  the  author  of  the \r\nVedänta-sütra. So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or \r\ntranscendental knowledge. Now the Lord  says that this Ninth Chapter is the \r\nking of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived \r\nfrom the study of the  Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most \r\nconfidential     because     confidential     or  transcendental       knowledge      involves \r\nunderstanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of \r\nall confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service. \r\n    Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are \r\neducated  in  external  knowledge.  As  far  as  ordinary  education  is  concerned, \r\npeople  are  involved  with  so  many  departments:  politics,  sociology,  physics, \r\nchemistry,  mathematics,  astronomy,  engineering,  etc.  There  are  so  many \r\ndepartments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but \r\nthere  is,  unfortunately,  no  university  or  educational  institution  where  the \r\nscience of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part \r\nof  the  body;  without  the  presence  of  the  soul,  the  body  has  no  value.  Still \r\npeople are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for \r\nthe vital soul. \r\n    The  Bhagavad-gétä,  especially  from  the  Second  Chapter  on,  stresses  the"

In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is \r\nperishable and that the soul is not perishable (antavanta ime dehä nityasyoktäù \r\nçarériëaù). That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that the \r\nspirit  soul  is  different  from  this  body  and  that  its  nature  is  immutable, \r\nindestructible  and  eternal.  But  that  gives  no  positive  information  about  the \r\nsoul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from \r\nthe body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, \r\nthe soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the \r\nfact. How can the soul, which is so  active within this body, be inactive after \r\nbeing  liberated  from  the  body?  It  is  always  active.  If  it  is  eternal,  then  it  is \r\neternally  active,  and  its  activities  in  the  spiritual  kingdom  are  the  most \r\nconfidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are \r\ntherefore  indicated  here  as  constituting  the  king  of  all  knowledge,  the  most \r\nconfidential part of all knowledge. \r\n    This  knowledge  is  the  purest  form  of  all  activities,  as  explained  in  Vedic \r\nliterature. In the Padma Puräëa, man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and \r\nare shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive \r\nactivities  are  entangled  in  different  stages  and  forms  of  sinful  reactions.  For \r\ninstance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear \r\nimmediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then \r\nit assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is \r\ncomplete,  the  flowers  and  fruits  are  enjoyed  by  persons  who  have  sown  the \r\nseed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes \r\ntime to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already \r\nstopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action \r\nare still to be enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and \r\nthere are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we \r\nare enjoying as distress and pain. \r\n    As explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person \r\nwho has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully \r\nengaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, \r\nbecomes   engaged   in   devotional   service   to   the   Supreme   Personality   of \r\nGodhead,  Kåñëa.

Therefore  the  purifying  potency  of \r\ndevotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. \r\nUttama means transcendental.  Tamas means this material world or darkness, \r\nand   uttama   means   that   which   is   transcendental   to   material   activities. \r\nDevotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes \r\nit appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see \r\nand  is  familiar  with  devotional  service  will  know  that  they  are  not  material \r\nactivities.  They  are  all  spiritual  and  devotional,  uncontaminated  by  the \r\nmaterial modes of nature. \r\n    It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can \r\nperceive  the  results  directly.  This  direct  result  is  actually  perceived,  and  we \r\nhave practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of \r\nKåñëa (Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare \r\nRäma,  Räma  Räma,  Hare  Hare)  in  course  of  chanting  without  offenses  feels \r\nsome transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material \r\ncontamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in \r\nhearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, \r\nor   if   he   engages   himself   in   helping   the   missionary   activities   of   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness,  he  gradually  feels  spiritual  progress.  This  advancement  in \r\nspiritual   life   does   not   depend   on   any   kind   of   previous   education   or \r\nqualification.  The  method  itself  is  so  pure  that  by  simply  engaging  in  it  one \r\nbecomes pure. \r\n    In the Vedänta-sütra (3.2.26) this is also described in the following words: \r\nprakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät. “Devotional service is so potent that simply by"

He was simply \r\nassisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the \r\ndevotees. The child Närada also got the opportunity and simply by association \r\nachieved  the  highest  goal  of  all  religion.  The  highest  goal  of  all  religion  is \r\ndevotional  service,  as  stated  in   Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (sa  vai  puàsäà  paro \r\ndharmo  yato  bhaktir  adhokñaje).  Religious  people  generally  do  not  know  that \r\nthe highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional service. As \r\nwe have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight (vedeñu \r\nyajïeñu     tapaùsu     caiva),     generally     Vedic      knowledge       is   required     for \r\nself-realization.  But  here,  although  Närada  never  went  to  the  school  of  the \r\nspiritual master and was not educated in the Vedic principles, he acquired the \r\nhighest  results  of  Vedic  study.  This  process  is  so  potent  that  even  without \r\nperforming  the  religious  process  regularly,  one  can  be  raised  to  the  highest \r\nperfection.  How  is  this  possible?  This  is  also  confirmed  in  Vedic  literature: \r\näcäryavän puruño veda. One who is in association with great äcäryas, even if he \r\nis not educated or has never studied the  Vedas, can become familiar with all \r\nthe knowledge necessary for realization. \r\n    The  process  of  devotional  service  is  a  very  happy  one  (susukham).  Why? \r\nDevotional service consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], so one can \r\nsimply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical \r\nlectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized  äcäryas. Simply by \r\nsitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to \r\nGod, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can \r\nexecute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The \r\nLord  says,  patraà  puñpaà  phalaà  toyam :  He  is  ready  to  accept  from  the \r\ndevotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of \r\nfruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be \r\noffered  by  any  person,  regardless  of  social  position,  and  will  be  accepted  if \r\noffered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting the \r\ntulasé leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumära \r\nbecame  great  devotees.  Therefore  the  devotional  process  is  very  nice,  and  it"

God accepts only the love with which things \r\nare offered to Him. \r\n    It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as \r\nthe  Mäyävädé  philosophers  claim.  Although they sometimes take to so-called \r\ndevotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will \r\ncontinue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, \r\nthey  will  “become  one  with  God.”  Such  temporary  time-serving  devotional \r\nservice  is  not  accepted  as  pure  devotional  service.  Actual  devotional  service \r\ncontinues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet \r\nin the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. \r\nHe does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord. \r\n    As  will  be  seen  in  Bhagavad-gétä,  actual  devotional  service  begins  after \r\nliberation.  After  one  is  liberated,  when  one  is  situated  in  the  Brahman \r\nposition   (brahma-bhüta),   one’s   devotional   service   begins   (samaù   sarveñu \r\nbhüteñu  mad-bhaktià  labhate  paräm).  No  one  can  understand  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead by executing  karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, añöäìga-yoga or \r\nany other  yoga independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little \r\nprogress  toward  bhakti-yoga,  but  without  coming  to  the  stage  of  devotional \r\nservice  one  cannot  understand  what  is  the  Personality  of  Godhead.  In  the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  it  is  also  confirmed  that  when  one  becomes  purified  by \r\nexecuting      the    process     of   devotional      service,     especially     by   hearing \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam          or   Bhagavad-gétä      from    realized    souls,   then    he    can \r\nunderstand       the    science     of   Kåñëa,     or    the    science     of   God.     Evaà \r\nprasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti yogataù. When one’s heart is cleared of all \r\nnonsense,   then   one   can   understand   what   God   is.   Thus   the   process   of \r\ndevotional service, of Kåñëa consciousness, is the king of all education and the \r\nking of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can \r\nbe executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it."

In    the \r\nCaitanya-caritämåta it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply \r\nby serving the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, one can achieve all perfection.

Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord \r\none  automatically  satisfies  all  the  demigods  and  all  other  living  entities.” \r\nTherefore,  after  reading  Bhagavad-gétä  one  should  promptly  come  to  the \r\nconclusion  of  Bhagavad-gétä:  one  should  give  up  all  other  engagements  and \r\nadopt the service of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. If \r\none is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith. \r\n    Now, the development of that faith is the process of Kåñëa consciousness. \r\nThere are three divisions of Kåñëa conscious men. In the third class are those \r\nwho  have  no  faith.  Even  if  they  are  officially  engaged  in  devotional  service, \r\nthey  cannot  achieve  the  highest  perfectional  stage.  Most  probably  they  will \r\nslip,  after  some  time.  They  may  become  engaged,  but  because  they  haven’t \r\ncomplete  conviction  and  faith,  it  is  very  difficult  for  them  to  continue  in \r\nKåñëa   consciousness.   We   have   practical   experience   in   discharging   our \r\nmissionary  activity  that  some  people  come  and  apply  themselves  to  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a \r\nlittle well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It \r\nis  only  by  faith  that  one  can  advance  in  Kåñëa  consciousness.  As  far  as  the \r\ndevelopment of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of \r\ndevotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class \r\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not \r\nvery    advanced       in    understanding         the    devotional      scriptures     but     who \r\nautomatically have firm faith that kåñëa-bhakti, or service to Kåñëa, is the best \r\ncourse  and  so  in  good  faith  have  taken  it  up.  Thus  they  are  superior  to  the \r\nthird  class,  who  have  neither  perfect  knowledge  of  the  scriptures  nor  good \r\nfaith  but  by  association  and  simplicity  are  trying  to  follow.  The  third-class \r\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second \r\nclass   he   does   not   fall   down,   and   for   the   first-class   person   in   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness  there  is  no  chance  of  falling  down.  One  in  the  first  class  will \r\nsurely make progress and achieve the result at the end.

Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under \r\nproper  guidance  is  He  revealed.  In  the  Brahma-saàhitä  (5.38)  it  is  stated, \r\npremäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti: one \r\ncan see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself \r\nand  outside  himself  if  one  has  developed  the  transcendental  loving  attitude \r\ntowards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that \r\nalthough He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the \r\nmaterial  senses.  This  is  indicated  here  by  the  word  avyakta-mürtinä.  But \r\nactually,  although  we  cannot  see  Him,  everything  is  resting  in  Him.  As  we \r\nhave    discussed     in   the    Seventh     Chapter,      the   entire    material     cosmic \r\nmanifestation   is   only   a   combination   of   His   two   different   energies—the \r\nsuperior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine \r\nis  spread  all  over  the  universe,  the  energy  of  the  Lord  is  spread  all  over  the \r\ncreation, and everything is resting in that energy. \r\n    Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost \r\nHis  personal  existence.  To  refute  such  an  argument  the  Lord  says,  “I  am \r\neverywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.” For example, a king \r\nheads a government which is but the manifestation of the king’s energy; the \r\ndifferent governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king,"

But  still  one  cannot \r\nexpect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude \r\nexample.  Similarly,  all  the  manifestations  that  we  see  and  everything  that \r\nexists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the \r\nenergy  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  The  creation  takes  place  by \r\nthe  diffusion  of  His  different  energies,  and,  as  stated  in  the  Bhagavad-gétä, \r\nviñöabhyäham   idaà   kåtsnam:   He   is   everywhere   present   by   His   personal \r\nrepresentation, the diffusion of His different energies."

    "text": "The Lord says that everything is resting on Him (mat-sthäni sarva-bhütäni). \r\nThis should not be misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the \r\nmaintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see \r\na picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, \r\nholding this great earthly planet. Such  an image should not be entertained in \r\nconnection   with   Kåñëa’s   upholding   this   created   universe.   He   says   that \r\nalthough everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are \r\nfloating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is \r\ndifferent  from  space.  He  is  differently  situated.  Therefore  the  Lord  says, \r\n“Although  they  are  situated  on  My  inconceivable  energy,  as  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead  I  am  aloof  from  them.”  This  is  the  inconceivable \r\nopulence of the Lord. \r\n    In the Nirukti Vedic dictionary it is said,  yujyate ’nena durghaöeñu käryeñu: \r\n“The     Supreme      Lord    is   performing      inconceivably       wonderful      pastimes, \r\ndisplaying His energy.” His person is full of different potent energies, and His \r\ndetermination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to \r\nbe  understood.  We  may  think  of  doing  something,  but  there  are  so  many \r\nimpediments, and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like. But when Kåñëa \r\nwants  to  do  something,  simply  by  His  willing,  everything  is  performed  so \r\nperfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this \r\nfact:  although  He  is  the  maintainer  and  sustainer  of  the  entire  material \r\nmanifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His \r\nsupreme  will,  everything  is  created,  everything  is  sustained,  everything  is \r\nmaintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His \r\nmind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present \r\nmaterial  mind)  because  He  is  absolute  spirit.  Simultaneously  the  Lord  is \r\npresent in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also \r\npresent  personally.  He  is  different  from  this  material  manifestation,  yet \r\neverything  is  resting  on  Him.  This  is  explained  here  as  yogam  aiçvaram,  the \r\nmystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Kåñëa also states \r\nin Bhagavad-gétä that of all of the living entities in different forms and species, \r\n“I am the father.” The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the \r\nchild, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living \r\nentities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different \r\nforms and species, according to their last desires and activities.

Actually, He is \r\nthe  original  Supreme  Personality,  as  is  confirmed  in  the  Brahma-saàhitä \r\n(éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù); He is the Supreme Lord. \r\n    There are many  éçvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. \r\nIn  the  ordinary  management  of  affairs  in  the  material  world,  we  find  some \r\nofficial  or  director,  and  above  him  there  is  a  secretary,  and  above  him  a \r\nminister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is \r\ncontrolled  by  another.  In  the  Brahma-saàhitä  it  is  said  that  Kåñëa  is  the \r\nsupreme  controller;  there  are  many  controllers  undoubtedly,  both  in  the \r\nmaterial  and  spiritual  world,  but  Kåñëa  is  the  supreme  controller  (éçvaraù \r\nparamaù kåñëaù ). and His body is sac-cid-änanda, nonmaterial. \r\n    Material  bodies  cannot  perform  the  wonderful  acts  described  in  previous \r\nverses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a \r\ncommon man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body \r\nis  called  here  mänuñém  because  He  is  acting  just  like  a  man,  a  friend  of \r\nArjuna’s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kurukñetra. In so many ways He \r\nis   acting     just   like    an    ordinary      man,     but    actually     His    body     is \r\nsac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]—eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is \r\nconfirmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-änanda-rüpäya kåñëäya: “I offer \r\nmy  obeisances  unto  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  Kåñëa,  who  is  the \r\neternal  blissful  form  of  knowledge.”  (Gopäla-täpané  Upaniñad  1.1)  There  are \r\nother descriptions  in the Vedic language also.  Tam ekaà govindam: “You are \r\nGovinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.”  Sac-cid-änanda-vigraham: \r\n“And  Your  form  is  transcendental,  full  of  knowledge,  bliss  and  eternality.” \r\n(Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.35) \r\n    Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Kåñëa’s body, its full bliss and \r\nknowledge,       there    are   many      so-called    scholars     and    commentators        of \r\nBhagavad-gétä who deride Kåñëa as an ordinary man.

Because  they  do  not  know  that  Kåñëa  has  so  many \r\ntranscendental qualifications, they deride Him. \r\n    Nor  do  they  know  that  the  appearance  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is \r\nthe  master  of  the  material  energy.  As  has  been  explained  in  several  places \r\n(mama  mäyä  duratyayä),  He  claims  that  the  material  energy,  although  very \r\npowerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out \r\nof the control of this material energy.  If a soul surrendered to Kåñëa can get \r\nout of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who \r\nconducts  the  creation,  maintenance  and  annihilation  of  the  whole  cosmic \r\nnature, have a material body like us? So this conception of Kåñëa is complete \r\nfoolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of \r\nGodhead, Kåñëa, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of \r\nall  the  atoms  and  of  the  gigantic  manifestation  of  the  universal  form.  The \r\nbiggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine \r\nthat a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite \r\nand  the  minute.  Actually  although  He  is  controlling  the  infinite  and  the \r\nfinite,  He  is  apart  from  all  this  manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning \r\nHis  yogam  aiçvaram,  His  inconceivable  transcendental  energy,  that  He  can \r\ncontrol  the  infinite  and  the  finite  simultaneously  and  that  He  can  remain \r\naloof  from  them.  Although  the  foolish  cannot  imagine  how  Kåñëa,  who \r\nappears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those \r\nwho are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Kåñëa is the Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead.  Therefore  they  completely  surrender  unto  Him  and \r\nengage in Kåñëa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord. \r\n    There     are   many     controversies      between     the    impersonalists      and    the \r\npersonalists about the Lord’s appearance as a human being. But if we consult \r\nBhagavad-gétä        and     Çrémad-Bhägavatam,          the     authoritative       texts    for \r\nunderstanding the science of Kåñëa, then we can understand that Kåñëa is the"

He  is  not  an  ordinary  man,  although  He \r\nappeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, First \r\nCanto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by Çaunaka inquired about the \r\nactivities of Kåñëa, they said:"

No   human   being   could   perform   the   wonderful   acts   that   Kåñëa \r\nperformed while He was present on this earth. When Kåñëa appeared before \r\nHis father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaké, He appeared with four hands, \r\nbut after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary \r\nchild.  As  stated  in  the  Bhägavatam  (10.3.46),  babhüva  präkåtaù  çiçuù:  He \r\nbecame just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again \r\nit is indicated that the Lord’s appearance as an ordinary human being is one of \r\nthe   features   of   His   transcendental   body.   In   the   Eleventh   Chapter   of \r\nBhagavad-gétä also it is stated that Arjuna  prayed to see Kåñëa’s form of four \r\nhands (tenaiva rüpeëa catur-bhujena). After revealing this form, Kåñëa, when \r\npetitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (mänuñaà \r\nrüpam). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those \r\nof an ordinary human being. \r\n    Some of those who deride Kåñëa and who are infected with the Mäyävädé \r\nphilosophy quote the following verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.29.21) to \r\nprove     that   Kåñëa     is   just   an   ordinary     man.     Ahaà      sarveñu    bhüteñu \r\nbhütätmävasthitaù sadä: “The Supreme is present in every living entity.” We \r\nshould better take note of this particular verse from the Vaiñëava äcäryas like \r\nJéva  Gosvämé  and  Viçvanätha  Cakravarté  Öhäkura  instead  of  following  the \r\ninterpretation   of   unauthorized   persons   who   deride   Kåñëa.   Jéva   Gosvämé, \r\ncommenting  on  this  verse,  says  that  Kåñëa,  in  His  plenary  expansion  as"

The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the \r\ntemple than to other devotees, so Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura warns that \r\nthis sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because \r\nKåñëa   is   present   in   everyone’s   heart   as   Paramätmä,   every   body   is   the \r\nembodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the \r\ntemple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in \r\nwhich  the  Paramätmä  dwells.  Everyone  should  therefore  be  given  proper \r\nrespect and should not be neglected. \r\n    There  are  also  many  impersonalists  who  deride  temple  worship.  They  say \r\nthat  since  God  is  everywhere,  why  should  one  restrict  himself  to  temple \r\nworship?  But  if  God  is  everywhere,  is  He not in the temple or in the Deity? \r\nAlthough  the  personalist  and  the  impersonalist  will  fight  with  one  another \r\nperpetually,  a  perfect  devotee  in  Kåñëa  consciousness  knows  that  although \r\nKåñëa  is  the  Supreme  Personality,  He  is  all-pervading,  as  confirmed  in  the \r\nBrahma-saàhitä. Although His personal abode is Goloka Våndävana and He is \r\nalways  staying  there,  by  His  different  manifestations  of  energy  and  by  His \r\nplenary  expansion  He  is  present  everywhere  in  all  parts  of  the  material  and \r\nspiritual creation."

He is not \r\nunder  the  control  of  material  nature.  And  how  is  this  effected?  That  is \r\nexplained  in  the  Seventh  Chapter:  one  who  surrenders  unto  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, at once becomes freed from the control of \r\nmaterial  nature.  That  is  the  qualification.  One  can  become  free  from  the \r\ncontrol  of  material  nature  as  soon  as  he  surrenders  his  soul  to  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead.  That  is  the  preliminary  formula.  Being  marginal \r\npotency,  as  soon  as  the  living  entity  is  freed  from  the  control  of  material \r\nnature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of \r\nthe  spiritual  nature  is  called  daivé  prakåti,  divine  nature.  So  when  one  is \r\npromoted   in   that   way—by   surrendering   to   the   Supreme   Personality   of \r\nGodhead—one attains to the stage of great soul, mahätmä. \r\n    The  mahätmä  does  not  divert  his  attention  to  anything  outside  Kåñëa, \r\nbecause he knows perfectly well that Kåñëa is the original Supreme Person, the \r\ncause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mahätmä, or great soul, \r\ndevelops   through   association   with   other   mahätmäs,   pure   devotees.

He is described \r\nin  a  different  way  in  the  next  verse.  The  mahätmä  is  always  engaged  in \r\ndifferent      activities     of    devotional       service,     as    described       in    the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam,  hearing  and  chanting  about  Viñëu,  not  a  demigod  or \r\nhuman  being.  That  is  devotion:  çravaëaà  kértanaà  viñëoù  and  smaraëam, \r\nremembering Him. Such a mahätmä has firm determination to achieve at the \r\nultimate  end  the  association  of  the  Supreme  Lord  in  any  one  of  the  five \r\ntranscendental        rasas.     To     achieve      that     success,     he     engages      all \r\nactivities—mental,   bodily   and   vocal,   everything—in   the   service   of   the \r\nSupreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa. That is called full Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    In   devotional     service    there    are   certain    activities    which     are   called \r\ndetermined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, \r\nEkädaçé,   and   on   the   appearance   day   of   the   Lord.   All   these   rules   and \r\nregulations   are   offered   by   the   great  äcäryas  for  those  who  are  actually \r\ninterested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality \r\nof  Godhead  in  the  transcendental  world.  The  mahätmäs,  great  souls,  strictly \r\nobserve all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve \r\nthe desired result. \r\n    As described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional \r\nservice easy, but it can be performed  in a happy mood. One does not need to \r\nundergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional \r\nservice, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a \r\nhouseholder  or  a  sannyäsé  or  a  brahmacäré;  in  any  position  and  anywhere  in \r\nthe world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality \r\nof Godhead and thus become actually mahätmä, a great soul."

That subject matter which helps \r\nus  purify  our  constitutional  position  is  especially  Kåñëa.  Similarly,  the  living \r\nentity  who  is  inquisitive  to  understand  all  Vedic  principles  is  also  part  and \r\nparcel of Kåñëa and as such is also Kåñëa. In all the Vedic  mantras the word \r\noà, called praëava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also Kåñëa. And \r\nbecause     in   all  the   hymns      of  the    four   Vedas—Säma,         Yajur,    Åg   and \r\nAtharva—the  praëava,  or  oàkära,  is  very  prominent,  it  is  understood  to  be \r\nKåñëa."

Similarly,  the  process  of  rendering  service  to \r\ndifferent parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, \r\nso to speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme \r\nLord.

The   officers   and   directors   are   engaged   as   representatives   of   the \r\ngovernment, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal.

It does not matter what one is \r\nor where one is situated. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water \r\nor fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will \r\nbe   pleased   to   accept   it.   No   one,   therefore,   can   be   barred   from   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such  a fool that he \r\ndoes not want to be Kåñëa conscious by this simple method and thus attain the \r\nhighest  perfectional  life  of  eternity,  bliss  and  knowledge?  Kåñëa  wants  only \r\nloving service and nothing more. Kåñëa accepts even a little flower from His \r\npure devotee. He does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee. He is \r\nnot in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He \r\naccepts the offering of His devotee in  an exchange of love and affection. To \r\ndevelop   Kåñëa   consciousness   is   the   highest   perfection   of   life.   Bhakti   is \r\nmentioned  twice  in  this  verse  in  order  to  declare  more  emphatically  that \r\nbhakti, or devotional service, is the only means to approach Kåñëa. No other \r\ncondition, such as becoming a brähmaëa. a learned scholar, a very rich man or \r\na  great  philosopher,  can  induce  Kåñëa  to  accept  some  offering.  Without  the \r\nbasic  principle  of  bhakti,  nothing  can  induce  the  Lord  to  agree  to  accept \r\nanything  from  anyone.  Bhakti  is  never  causal.  The  process  is  eternal.  It  is \r\ndirect action in service to the absolute whole. \r\n    Here  Lord  Kåñëa,  having  established  that  He  is  the  only  enjoyer,  the \r\nprimeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types \r\nof  sacrifices  He  desires  to  be  offered.  If  one  wishes  to  engage  in  devotional \r\nservice  to  the  Supreme  in  order  to  be  purified  and  to  reach  the  goal  of \r\nlife—the  transcendental  loving  service  of  God—then  one  should  find  out \r\nwhat the Lord desires of him. One who loves Kåñëa will give Him whatever He \r\nwants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus \r\nmeat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Kåñëa. If He desired such things as \r\nofferings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, \r\nflowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, “I will accept \r\nit.”  Therefore,  we  should  understand  that  He  will  not  accept  meat,  fish  and \r\neggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human \r\nbeings and are prescribed by Lord Kåñëa Himself.

Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the \r\nsame verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply \r\ndeepening  their  involvement  in  the  complexities  of  material  nature.  But \r\npreparing  nice,  simple  vegetable  dishes,  offering  them  before  the  picture  or \r\nDeity of Lord Kåñëa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a \r\nhumble offering enables one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and \r\nto  create  fine  brain  tissues  which  will  lead  to  clear  thinking.  Above  all,  the \r\noffering should be made with an attitude  of love. Kåñëa has no need of food, \r\nsince He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering \r\nof  one  who  desires  to  please  Him  in  that  way.  The  important  element,  in \r\npreparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Kåñëa. \r\n    The  impersonalist  philosophers,  who  wish  to  maintain  that  the  Absolute \r\nTruth  is  without  senses,  cannot  comprehend  this  verse  of  Bhagavad-gétä.  To \r\nthem, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kåñëa, the \r\nspeaker of the  Bhagavad-gétä. But, in actuality, Kåñëa, the Supreme Godhead, \r\nhas senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, \r\none sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say \r\nthat Kåñëa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all \r\nopulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kåñëa has explained that He impregnates \r\nthe  living  entities  into  material  nature.  This  is  done  by  His  looking  upon \r\nmaterial nature. And so in this instance, Kåñëa’s hearing the devotee’s words \r\nof love in offering foodstuffs is  wholly identical with His eating and actually \r\ntasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His \r\nhearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who \r\naccepts Kåñëa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand \r\nthat the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it."

Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits \r\nare  given  to  Kåñëa,  then  that  is  called  yukta-vairägya.  Actually  situated  in \r\nrenunciation,  such  activities  clear  the  mirror  of  the  mind,  and  as  the  actor \r\ngradually   makes   progress   in   spiritual   realization   he   becomes   completely \r\nsurrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he \r\nbecomes  liberated,  and  this  liberation  is  also  specified.  By  this  liberation  he \r\ndoes not become one with the brahmajyoti, but rather enters into the planet of \r\nthe Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here:  mäm upaiñyasi, “he comes to \r\nMe,” back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, \r\nand here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here \r\nunder the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point \r\nwhere he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly \r\nin the association of the Supreme Lord. \r\n    Anyone  who  has  no  interest  but  to  dedicate  his  life  to  the  service  of  the \r\nLord is actually a sannyäsé. Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal \r\nservant,  dependent  on  the  supreme  will  of  the  Lord.  As  such,  whatever  he \r\ndoes, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he \r\nperforms  it  as  service  to  the  Lord.  He  does  not  give  serious  attention  to  the \r\nfruitive  activities  or  prescribed  duties  mentioned  in  the  Vedas.  For  ordinary \r\npersons  it  is  obligatory  to  execute  the  prescribed  duties  mentioned  in  the \r\nVedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of \r\nthe  Lord  may  sometimes  appear  to  go  against  the  prescribed  Vedic  duties, \r\nactually it is not so. \r\n    It is said, therefore, by Vaiñëava authorities that even the most intelligent \r\nperson cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact \r\nwords  are  täìra  väkya,  kriyä,  mudrä  vijïeha  nä  bujhaya  (Caitanya-caritämåta, \r\nMadhya 23.39).

The Lord claims that every living \r\nentity—in  whatever  form—is  His  son,  and  so  He  provides  everyone  with  a \r\ngenerous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours \r\nrain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His \r\ndevotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they \r\nare    always     in   Kåñëa      consciousness,      and     therefore      they    are    always \r\ntranscendentally  situated  in  Kåñëa.  The  very  phrase  “Kåñëa  consciousness” \r\nsuggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, \r\nsituated  in  Him.  The  Lord  says  here  distinctly,  mayi  te:  “They  are  in  Me.” \r\nNaturally,  as  a  result,  the  Lord  is  also  in  them.  This  is  reciprocal.  This  also \r\nexplains  the  words  ye  yathä  mäà  prapadyante  täàs  tathaiva  bhajämy  aham: \r\n“Whoever  surrenders  unto  Me,  proportionately  I  take  care  of  him.”  This \r\ntranscendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are \r\nconscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold \r\nis glorified, and at the same time the  diamond is glorified. The Lord and the \r\nliving entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the \r\nservice of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so \r\nthis  combination  is  very  nice.  Living  entities  in  a  pure  state  are  called \r\ndevotees.  The  Supreme  Lord  becomes  the  devotee  of  His  devotees.  If  a \r\nreciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then \r\nthere  is  no  personalist  philosophy.  In  the  impersonal  philosophy  there  is  no \r\nreciprocation   between   the   Supreme   and   the   living   entity,   but   in   the \r\npersonalist philosophy there is. \r\n    The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever \r\none wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is \r\nmore complete. The Lord is here stated  to be partial to the devotees. This is \r\nthe  manifestation  of  the  Lord’s  special  mercy  to  the  devotees.  The  Lord’s \r\nreciprocation  should  not  be  considered  to  be  under  the  law  of  karma.  It \r\nbelongs  to  the  transcendental  situation  in  which  the  Lord  and  His  devotees \r\nfunction.  Devotional  service  to  the  Lord  is  not  an  activity  of  this  material \r\nworld;  it  is  part  of  the  spiritual  world,  where  eternity,  bliss  and  knowledge \r\npredominate."

Such activities are performed in his constitutional \r\nposition,  and  they  are  technically  called  devotional  service.  Now,  in  the \r\nconditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in \r\nrelation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these \r\nactivities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very \r\ncautious  so  that  he  does  not  do  anything  that  could  disrupt  his  wholesome \r\ncondition.   He   knows   that   perfection   in   his   activities   depends   on   his \r\nprogressive realization of Kåñëa consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be \r\nseen  that  a  person  in  Kåñëa  consciousness  commits  some  act  which  may  be \r\ntaken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown \r\ndoes not disqualify him. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that if a person \r\nfalls down but is wholeheartedly  engaged in the transcendental service of the \r\nSupreme  Lord,  the  Lord,  being  situated  within  his  heart,  purifies  him  and \r\nexcuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong \r\nthat even a  yogé fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes \r\nensnared;   but   Kåñëa   consciousness   is   so   strong   that   such   an   occasional \r\nfalldown  is  at  once  rectified.  Therefore  the  process  of  devotional  service  is \r\nalways a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown \r\nfrom  the  ideal  path,  for,  as  explained  in  the  next  verse,  such  occasional \r\nfalldowns  will  be  stopped  in  due  course,  as  soon  as  a  devotee  is  completely \r\nsituated in Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    Therefore a person who is situated in Kåñëa consciousness and is engaged \r\nwith determination in the process of chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa \r\nKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be \r\nconsidered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident \r\nhe  is  found  to  have  fallen.  The  words  sädhur  eva,  “he  is  saintly,”  are  very \r\nemphatic.   They   are   a   warning   to   the   nondevotees   that   because   of   an \r\naccidental  falldown  a  devotee  should  not  be  derided;  he  should  still  be \r\nconsidered  saintly  even  if  he  has  accidentally  fallen  down.  And  the  word \r\nmantavyaù is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a \r\ndevotee  for  his  accidental  falldown,  then  one  is  disobeying  the  order  of  the \r\nSupreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and \r\nexclusively engaged in devotional service."

But when one is strong enough, he \r\nis  no  longer  subjected  to  such  falldowns,  as  previously  explained.

The  question  remains,  then,  How  can  a  person  engaged  in \r\nabominable activities—either by accident or by intention—be a pure devotee? \r\nThis  question  may  justly  be  raised.  The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh \r\nChapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good \r\nqualifications, as is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

To him also the Lord says, “Take \r\nto My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back home.” No \r\none should remain in this temporary world, full as it is with miseries. Everyone \r\nshould attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so \r\nthat he can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is \r\nthe  only  process  by  which  all  problems  of  all  classes  of  men  can  be  solved. \r\nEveryone  should  therefore  take  to  Kåñëa  consciousness  and  make  his  life \r\nperfect."

Although this is \r\nsheer  ignorance  of  the  science  of  Kåñëa,  some  men  make  profit  out  of \r\nmisleading people. \r\n    There are some who are demonic; they  also think of Kåñëa, but enviously, \r\njust like King Kaàsa, Kåñëa’s uncle.

That  kind  of  thinking  will  not  help  us.  One \r\nshould  be  thinking  of  Kåñëa  in  devotional  love.  That  is  bhakti.  One  should \r\ncultivate   the   knowledge   of   Kåñëa   continuously.   What   is   that   favorable \r\ncultivation?  It  is  to  learn  from  a  bona  fide  teacher.  Kåñëa  is  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is \r\nnot material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about Kåñëa \r\nwill  help  one  become  a  devotee.  Understanding  Kåñëa  otherwise,  from  the \r\nwrong source, will prove fruitless. \r\n    One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form \r\nof Kåñëa; with conviction in his heart that Kåñëa is the Supreme, he should \r\nengage  himself  in  worship.  There  are  hundreds  of  thousands  of  temples  in \r\nIndia  for  the  worship  of  Kåñëa,  and  devotional  service  is  practiced  there. \r\nWhen such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to Kåñëa. One should \r\nlower   his   head   before   the   Deity   and   engage   his   mind,   his   body,   his \r\nactivities—everything.  That  will  make  one  fully  absorbed  in  Kåñëa  without \r\ndeviation.  This  will  help  one  transfer  to  the  Kåñëaloka.  One  should  not  be \r\ndeviated   by   unscrupulous   commentators.   One   must   engage   in   the   nine \r\ndifferent processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting \r\nabout  Kåñëa.  Pure  devotional  service  is  the  highest  achievement  of  human \r\nsociety. \r\n    The  Seventh  and  Eighth  chapters  of  Bhagavad-gétä  have  explained  pure \r\ndevotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic \r\nyoga  and  fruitive  activities.  Those  who  are  not  purely  sanctified  may  be \r\nattracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahmajyoti and \r\nlocalized  Paramätmä,  but  a  pure  devotee  directly  takes  to  the  service  of  the \r\nSupreme Lord. \r\n    There is a beautiful poem about Kåñëa in which it is clearly stated that any"

One  should  know,  then,  that  scholarship  is  not  the \r\nqualification necessary to understand Kåñëa. Even the demigods and the great \r\nsages  have  tried  to  understand  Kåñëa  by  their  mental  speculation,  and  they \r\nhave failed to do so. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is clearly said that even \r\nthe  great  demigods  are  not  able  to  understand  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can \r\nreach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested \r\nby  the  three  qualities  of  material  nature,  or  they  can  imagine  something  by \r\nmental speculation, but it is not possible to understand Kåñëa by such foolish \r\nspeculation. \r\n    Here  the  Lord  indirectly  says  that  if anyone wants to know the Absolute \r\nTruth, “Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the \r\nSupreme.”  One  should  know  this.  Although  one  cannot  understand  the \r\ninconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can \r\nactually understand Kåñëa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply \r\nby   studying     His   words     in   Bhagavad-gétä      and    Çrémad-Bhägavatam.         The \r\nconception of God as some ruling power or as the impersonal Brahman can be \r\nreached  by  persons  who  are  in  the  inferior  energy  of  the  Lord,  but  the \r\nPersonality     of   Godhead       cannot     be    conceived     unless    one    is   in   the \r\ntranscendental position. \r\n    Because most men cannot understand Kåñëa in His actual situation, out of \r\nHis causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators.

The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman \r\nconception   of   God;   their   faith   and   devotion   bring   them   to   surrender \r\nimmediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kåñëa \r\nthey can understand Kåñëa.

The  Lord  is  different  from  the  living  entities  who  are  taking  birth  and \r\ndying  due  to  material  attachment.  The  conditioned  souls  are  changing  their \r\nbodies, but His body is not changeable.  Even when He comes to this material \r\nworld, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said \r\nthat  the  Lord,  by  His  internal  potency,  is  not  under  the  inferior,  material \r\nenergy, but is always in the superior energy. \r\n    In this verse the words vetti loka-maheçvaram indicate that one should know \r\nthat  Lord  Kåñëa  is  the  supreme  proprietor  of  the  planetary  systems  of  the \r\nuniverse.  He  was  existing  before  the  creation,  and  He  is  different  from  His \r\ncreation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far \r\nas  Kåñëa  is  concerned,  it  is  said  that  He  is  not  created;  therefore  Kåñëa  is \r\ndifferent even from the great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva. And because He \r\nis the creator of Brahmä, Çiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme \r\nPerson of all planets. \r\n    Çré Kåñëa is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone \r\nwho   knows   Him   as   such   immediately   becomes   liberated   from   all   sinful \r\nreactions.  One  must  be  liberated  from  all  sinful  activities  to  be  in  the \r\nknowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known \r\nand not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä. \r\n    One  should  not  try  to  understand  Kåñëa  as  a  human  being.  As  stated \r\npreviously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again \r\nexpressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent \r\nenough  to  understand  the  constitutional  position  of  the  Godhead,  is  always \r\nfree from all sinful reactions. \r\n    If Kåñëa is known as the son of Devaké, then how can He be unborn? That \r\nis  also  explained  in  Çrémad-Bhägavatam:  When  He  appeared  before  Devaké \r\nand  Vasudeva,  He  was  not  born  as  an  ordinary  child;  He  appeared  in  His \r\noriginal form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. \r\n    Anything done under the direction of Kåñëa is transcendental. It cannot be \r\ncontaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious."

Everything is inauspicious because the very \r\nmaterial  nature  is  inauspicious.  We  simply  imagine  it  to  be  auspicious.  Real \r\nauspiciousness  depends  on  activities  in  Kåñëa  consciousness  in  full  devotion \r\nand service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we \r\nshould  work  under  the  directions  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  Such  directions  are \r\ngiven     in    authoritative       scriptures     such     as   Çrémad-Bhägavatam           and \r\nBhagavad-gétä,  or  from  a  bona  fide  spiritual  master.

The  spiritual  master,  saintly  persons  and \r\nscriptures  direct  in  the  same  way.  There  is  no  contradiction  in  these  three \r\nsources. All actions done under such  direction are free from the reactions of \r\npious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude \r\nof the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, \r\nand this is called sannyäsa. As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter of \r\nBhagavad-gétä, one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to \r\ndo so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his \r\nactivities (anäçritaù karma-phalam), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under \r\nthe direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyäsé and a yogé, and not the \r\nman who has simply taken the dress of the sannyäsé, or a pseudo yogé."

In modern education there \r\nis  no  knowledge  about  spirit;  they  are  simply  taking  care  of  the  material \r\nelements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete. \r\n    Asammoha, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is \r\nnot hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly \r\nbut  surely  he  becomes  free  from  bewilderment.  Nothing  should  be  accepted \r\nblindly;  everything  should  be  accepted  with  care  and  with  caution.  Kñamä, \r\ntolerance  and  forgiveness,  should  be  practiced;  one  should  be  tolerant  and \r\nexcuse  the  minor  offenses  of  others.  Satyam,  truthfulness,  means  that  facts \r\nshould be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts should not be \r\nmisrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak \r\nthe truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The \r\ntruth should be spoken in a straightforward way, so that others will understand \r\nactually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he \r\nis  a  thief,  that  is  truth.  Although  sometimes  the  truth  is  unpalatable,  one \r\nshould  not  refrain  from  speaking  it.  Truthfulness  demands  that  the  facts  be \r\npresented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth. \r\n    Control  of  the  senses  means  that  the  senses  should  not  be  used  for \r\nunnecessary personal enjoyment. There  is no prohibition against meeting the \r\nproper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for \r\nspiritual   advancement.   Therefore   the   senses   should   be   restrained   from \r\nunnecessary  use.  Similarly,  one  should  restrain  the  mind  from  unnecessary \r\nthoughts; that is called çama. One should not spend one’s time pondering over \r\nearning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be \r\nused to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be \r\npresented  authoritatively.  The  power  of  thought  should  be  developed  in \r\nassociation with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons \r\nand spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed.  Sukham, \r\npleasure  or  happiness,  should  always  be  in  that  which  is  favorable  for  the \r\ncultivation of the spiritual knowledge  of Kåñëa consciousness. And similarly, \r\nthat which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for \r\nthe    cultivation     of   Kåñëa     consciousness.

As far as the soul is \r\nconcerned,  there  is  neither  birth  nor  death;  that  we  have  discussed  in  the \r\nbeginning of Bhagavad-gétä. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the \r\nmaterial  world.  Fear  is  due  to  worrying  about  the  future.  A  person  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the \r\nspiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright. \r\nOthers,   however,   do   not   know   what   their   future   holds;   they   have   no \r\nknowledge  of  what  the  next  life  holds.  So  they  are  therefore  in  constant \r\nanxiety.  If  we  want  to  get  free  from  anxiety,  then  the  best  course  is  to \r\nunderstand Kåñëa and be situated always in Kåñëa consciousness.

But  those  who  are  free  from  the  illusory  energy,  those  who  are \r\nconfident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of \r\nthe  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  and  who  are  therefore  engaged  in  the \r\ntranscendental service of the Supreme  Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their \r\nfuture is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness.   Abhayam,   fearlessness,   is   possible   only   for   one   in   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness. \r\n    Ahiàsä,  nonviolence,  means  that  one  should  not  do  anything  which  will \r\nput others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so \r\nmany politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good \r\nresults  because  the  politicians  and  philanthropists  have  no  transcendental \r\nvision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiàsä \r\nmeans that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of \r\nthe  human  body  can  be  achieved.  The  human  body  is  meant  for  spiritual \r\nrealization,  so  any  movement  or  any  commissions  which  do  not  further  that \r\nend  commit  violence  on  the  human  body.  That  which  furthers  the  future \r\nspiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence. \r\n    Samatä, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be \r\nvery much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material \r\nworld  should  be  accepted  without  attachment  or  aversion.  That  which  is"

A person \r\nin  Kåñëa  consciousness  has  nothing  to  reject  and  nothing  to  accept  save  in \r\nterms of its usefulness in the prosecution of Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    Tuñöi, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and \r\nmore  material  goods  by  unnecessary  activity.  One  should  be  satisfied  with \r\nwhatever  is  obtained  by  the  grace  of  the  Supreme  Lord;  that  is  called \r\nsatisfaction.  Tapas  means  austerity  or  penance.  There  are  many  rules  and \r\nregulations in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and \r\ntaking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, \r\nbut whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. \r\nSimilarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One \r\nmay not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination \r\nto make advancement in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, he should accept \r\nsuch  bodily  troubles  when  they  are  recommended.  However,  one  should  not \r\nfast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some \r\npolitical  purpose;  that  is  described  in  Bhagavad-gétä  as  fasting  in  ignorance, \r\nand   anything   done   in   ignorance   or   passion   does   not   lead   to   spiritual \r\nadvancement.  Everything  done  in  the  mode  of  goodness  does  advance  one, \r\nhowever, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in \r\nspiritual knowledge. \r\n    As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings \r\nto some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in \r\nterms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause. \r\nBecause Kåñëa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a \r\nperson who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic literature, \r\nit is enjoined that charity should be given to the  brähmaëas. This practice is \r\nstill followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But \r\nstill  the  injunction  is  that  charity  should  be  given  to  the  brähmaëas.  Why? \r\nBecause  they  are  engaged  in  higher  cultivation  of  spiritual  knowledge.  A \r\nbrähmaëa  is  supposed  to  devote  his  whole  life  to  understanding  Brahman. \r\nBrahma  jänätéti  brähmaëaù:  one  who  knows  Brahman  is  called  a  brähmaëa. \r\nThus charity is offered to the  brähmaëas because they are always engaged in"

In the Vedic \r\nliterature, charity is also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life, \r\nthe  sannyäsé.  The  sannyäsés  beg  from  door  to  door,  not  for  money  but  for \r\nmissionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken \r\nthe householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are \r\nengaged   in   family   affairs   and   have   forgotten   their   actual   purpose   in \r\nlife—awakening their Kåñëa consciousness—it is the business of the sannyäsés \r\nto  go  as  beggars  to  the  householders  and  encourage  them  to  be  Kåñëa \r\nconscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due \r\nhim in this human form of life. This  knowledge and method is distributed by \r\nthe  sannyäsés;  hence  charity  is  to  be  given  to  the  renouncer  of  life,  to  the \r\nbrähmaëas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause. \r\n    Yaças, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is \r\nfamous  when  he  is  known  as  a  great  devotee.  That  is  real  fame.  If  one  has \r\nbecome a great man in Kåñëa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly \r\nfamous. One who does not have such fame is infamous. \r\n    All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society \r\nand  in  the  society  of  the  demigods.  There  are  many  forms  of  humanity  on \r\nother  planets,  and  these  qualities  are  there.  Now,  for  one  who  wants  to \r\nadvance  in  Kåñëa  consciousness,  Kåñëa  creates  all  these  qualities,  but  the \r\nperson develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional \r\nservice of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the \r\nSupreme Lord. \r\n    Of  whatever  we  find,  good  or  bad,  the  origin  is  Kåñëa.  Nothing  can \r\nmanifest itself in this material world which is not in Kåñëa. That is knowledge; \r\nalthough we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that \r\neverything flows from Kåñëa."

Once  situated  in  that  transcendental \r\nposition, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord \r\nin  His  abode.  Lord  Caitanya  likens  transcendental  devotional  service  to  the \r\nsowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living \r\nentities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of \r\nthem there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get \r\nthe  chance  to  understand  devotional  service.  This  devotional  service  is  just \r\nlike a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on \r\nhearing and chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare \r\nRäma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed \r\nof  a  tree  fructifies  with  regular  watering.  The  spiritual  plant  of  devotional \r\nservice  gradually  grows  and  grows  until  it  penetrates  the  covering  of  the \r\nmaterial  universe  and  enters  into  the  brahmajyoti  effulgence  in  the  spiritual \r\nsky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches \r\nthe highest planet, which is called Goloka Våndävana, the supreme planet of \r\nKåñëa.  Ultimately,  the  plant  takes  shelter  under  the  lotus  feet  of  Kåñëa  and \r\nrests  there.  Gradually,  as  a  plant  grows  fruits  and  flowers,  that  plant  of \r\ndevotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of \r\nchanting  and  hearing  goes  on.  This  plant  of  devotional  service  is  fully \r\ndescribed  in  the  Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya-lélä,  Chapter  Nineteen).  It  is \r\nexplained  there  that  when  the  complete  plant  takes  shelter  under  the  lotus \r\nfeet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he \r\ncannot  live  even  for  a  moment  without  being  in  contact  with  the  Supreme \r\nLord,  just  as  a  fish  cannot  live  without  water.  In  such  a  state,  the  devotee \r\nactually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord. \r\n    The     Çrémad-Bhägavatam          is  also    full  of   such     narrations     about     the \r\nrelationship  between  the  Supreme  Lord  and  His  devotees;  therefore  the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the  Bhägavatam \r\nitself (12.13.18).

This  complete  yoga  is  the  highest \r\nperfectional stage of life. \r\n    A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a \r\nspiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress, \r\nthen Kåñëa from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come \r\nto  Him  without  difficulty.  The  qualification  is  that  a  person  always  engage \r\nhimself in Kåñëa consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of \r\nservices. He should perform some sort of work for Kåñëa, and that work should \r\nbe  with  love.  If  a  devotee  is  not  intelligent  enough  to  make  progress  on  the \r\npath   of   self-realization   but   is   sincere   and   devoted   to   the   activities   of \r\ndevotional   service,   the   Lord   gives   him   a   chance   to   make   progress   and \r\nultimately attain to Him."

Man \r\ncan go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if \r\nhe is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kåñëa, or the \r\nSupreme  Truth.  Only  by  devotional  service  is  the  Supreme  Truth,  Kåñëa, \r\npleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of \r\nthe  pure  devotee.  The  pure  devotee  always  has  Kåñëa  within  his  heart;  and \r\nwith the presence of Kåñëa, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance \r\nis at once dissipated. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by \r\nKåñëa. \r\n    Due  to  the  contamination  of  material  association,  through  many,  many \r\nmillions of births, one’s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, \r\nbut when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Kåñëa, \r\nthe dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. \r\nThe ultimate goal, Viñëu, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional \r\nservice, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not \r\nhave  to  worry  about  the  material  necessities  of  life; he need not be anxious, \r\nbecause when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided \r\nautomatically  by  the  Supreme  Lord,  who  is  pleased  by  the  loving  devotional \r\nservice of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gétä. By \r\nstudying  Bhagavad-gétä, one can become a soul completely surrendered to the \r\nSupreme  Lord  and  engage  himself  in  pure  devotional  service.  As  the  Lord \r\ntakes  charge,  one  becomes  completely  free  from  all  kinds  of  materialistic \r\nendeavors."

    "text": "In  these  two  verses  the  Supreme  Lord  gives  a  chance  to  the  modern \r\nphilosopher,  for  here  it  is  clear  that  the  Supreme  is  different  from  the \r\nindividual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gétä \r\n[BG.  10.8-11]  in  this  chapter,  became  completely  free  from  all  doubts  and \r\naccepted  Kåñëa  as  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  He  at  once  boldly \r\ndeclares, “You are paraà brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And \r\npreviously Kåñëa stated that He is the originator of everything and everyone. \r\nEvery  demigod  and  every  human  being  is  dependent  on  Him.  Men  and \r\ndemigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of \r\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by \r\nthe  discharge  of  devotional  service.  This  has  already  been  explained  in  the \r\nprevious verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the \r\nSupreme  Truth,  in  concordance  with  the  Vedic  injunction.  It  is  not  that \r\nbecause Kåñëa is Arjuna’s intimate friend Arjuna is flattering  Him by calling \r\nHim  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  the  Absolute  Truth.  Whatever \r\nArjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions \r\naffirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can \r\nunderstand  Him,  whereas  others  cannot.  Each  and  every  word  of  this  verse \r\nspoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction. \r\n    In the Kena Upaniñad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for \r\neverything, and Kåñëa has already explained that everything is resting on Him. \r\nThe Muëòaka Upaniñad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything \r\nis resting, can be realized only by those who engage  constantly in thinking of \r\nHim.  This  constant  thinking  of  Kåñëa  is  smaraëam,  one  of  the  methods  of \r\ndevotional  service.  It  is  only  by  devotional  service  to  Kåñëa  that  one  can \r\nunderstand his position and get rid of this material body. \r\n    In the  Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One \r\nwho understands that Kåñëa is the purest of the pure can become purified from \r\nall sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he \r\nsurrenders  unto  the  Supreme  Lord.  Arjuna’s  acceptance  of  Kåñëa  as  the \r\nsupreme  pure  complies  with  the  injunctions  of  Vedic  literature.  This  is  also"

He \r\nis the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not \r\nonly does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the  Puräëas and \r\nhistories.  In  all  Vedic  literatures  Kåñëa  is  thus  described,  and  the  Supreme \r\nLord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am unborn, I appear \r\non this earth to establish religious principles.” He is the supreme origin; He has \r\nno cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from \r\nHim. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord. \r\n    Here  Arjuna  expresses  himself  through  the  grace  of  Kåñëa.  If  we  want  to \r\nunderstand  Bhagavad-gétä,  we  should  accept  the  statements  in  these  two \r\nverses.   This   is   called   the  paramparä   system,   acceptance   of   the   disciplic \r\nsuccession.  Unless  one  is  in  the  disciplic  succession,  he  cannot  understand \r\nBhagavad-gétä.      It   is   not    possible     by   so-called     academic      education. \r\nUnfortunately  those  proud  of  their  academic  education,  despite  so  much \r\nevidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kåñëa is \r\nan ordinary person."

By  the  grace  of  the \r\nSupreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Kåñëa and \r\nthat He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He \r\nreceived the authority of  Bhagavad-gétä.

Therefore,  as  stated  in  our  Introduction  to  Gétopaniñad, \r\nBhagavad-gétä  should  be  understood  in  the  paramparä  system.  When  the \r\nparamparä   system   was   lost,   Arjuna   was   selected   to   rejuvenate   it.

Now  Arjuna  is  convinced  that  His  friend,  Kåñëa,  is  the  Supreme \r\nGodhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading \r\nLord  can  be  understood  by  the  common  man.  Common  men,  including  the \r\ndemons  and  atheists,  cannot  know  Kåñëa,  because  He  is  guarded  by  His \r\nyoga-mäyä  energy.  Again,  these  questions  are  asked  by  Arjuna  for  their \r\nbenefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding \r\nbut for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because \r\nhe is a Vaiñëava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding \r\nof the all-pervasiveness of the  Supreme Lord. He addresses Kåñëa specifically \r\nas yogin because Çré Kåñëa is the master of the yoga-mäyä energy, by which He \r\nis covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no \r\nlove  for  Kåñëa  cannot  always  think  of  Kåñëa;  therefore  he  has  to  think \r\nmaterially.

Rather, the very topics of Kåñëa are \r\nso  relishable  that  they  appear  to  the  devotees  as  nectar.  Thus  the  devotees \r\nenjoy them. In discussing Kåñëa’s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure \r\ndevotees  take  transcendental  pleasure.  Therefore  they  want  to  hear  and \r\ndiscuss them. Kåñëa knows that living entities do not understand the extent of \r\nHis opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of \r\nHis different energies. The word prädhänyataù (“principal”) is very important \r\nbecause we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme \r\nLord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. \r\nAnd vibhüti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls \r\nthe whole manifestation.

Thus this address by Kåñëa to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is \r\nabove such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various \r\nopulences. \r\n    Kåñëa  first  informs  Arjuna  that  He  is  the  soul  of  the  entire  cosmic \r\nmanifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, \r\nthe Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the puruña incarnations, \r\nand  from  Him  everything  begins.  Therefore  He  is  ätmä,  the  soul  of  the \r\nmahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause"

He is the soul. When Mahä-Viñëu enters into the manifested \r\nuniverses,  He  again  manifests  Himself  as  the  Supersoul  in  each  and  every \r\nentity.

The  Mahä-Viñëu,  or  Käraëodakaçäyé  Viñëu,  is \r\ndescribed  in  the  Brahma-saàhitä  (5.47).  Yaù  käraëärëava-jale  bhajati  sma \r\nyoga-nidräm: the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, the cause of all causes, lies down in the \r\ncosmic ocean as Mahä-Viñëu.

    "text": "It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the  Vedas, He is \r\nthe  Säma  Veda.  The  Säma  Veda  is  rich  with  beautiful  songs  played  by  the \r\nvarious demigods. One of these songs is the Båhat-säma, which has an exquisite \r\nmelody and is sung at midnight. \r\n    In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter \r\nare not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated \r\npoetry, the Gäyatré mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified  brähmaëas, \r\nis   the   most     prominent.      The     Gäyatré     mantra     is   mentioned       in   the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam.  Because  the  Gäyatré  mantra  is  especially  meant  for  God \r\nrealization,   it   represents   the   Supreme   Lord.   This   mantra   is   meant   for \r\nspiritually  advanced  people,  and  when  one  attains  success  in  chanting  it,  he \r\ncan enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire \r\nthe   qualities   of   the   perfectly   situated   person,   the   qualities   of   goodness \r\naccording to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gäyatré mantra. \r\nThe Gäyatré  mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered \r\nto  be  the  sound  incarnation  of  Brahman.  Brahmä  is  its  initiator,  and  it  is \r\npassed down from him in disciplic succession. \r\n    The  month  of  November-December  is  considered  the  best  of  all  months \r\nbecause in India grains are collected from the fields at this time and the people \r\nbecome very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is \r\nneither too hot nor too cold and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In \r\nspring  there  are  also  many  ceremonies  commemorating  Kåñëa’s  pastimes; \r\ntherefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the \r\nrepresentative of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa."

This  word  is \r\nalso very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient \r\nknowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations \r\nare but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest \r\nthat  perhaps  it  was  like  this,  or  maybe  like  that,  but  there  is  no  question  of \r\n“perhaps”  and  “maybe.”  There  is  a  specific  plan  being  carried  out  in  this \r\nmaterial world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for \r\nthe conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long as they \r\nhave the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material \r\nnature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the \r\nSupreme  Lord  and  cultivate  Kåñëa  consciousness  is  most  intelligent.  The \r\ncreation  and  destruction  of  the  cosmic  manifestation  are  under  the  superior \r\nguidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kurukñetra was fought according to the \r\nplan of God. Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight \r\nin accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. \r\nIf  one  is  in  full  Kåñëa  consciousness  and  his  life  is  devoted  to  the  Lord’s \r\ntranscendental service, he is perfect."

He is the shelter of the whole \r\nuniverse.  Arjuna  also  thought  that  it  was  fitting  that  all  the  perfect  living \r\nentities  and  powerful  demigods  offer  their  respectful  obeisances  unto  Him, \r\nbecause no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that Kåñëa is \r\ngreater than Brahmä because Brahmä is created by Him. Brahmä is born out of \r\nthe lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who \r\nis Kåñëa’s plenary expansion; therefore Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who is born of \r\nBrahmä,  and  all  other  demigods  must  offer  their  respectful  obeisances.  It  is \r\nstated  in  Çrémad-Bhägavatam  that  the  Lord  is  respected  by  Lord  Çiva  and \r\nBrahmä  and  similar  other  demigods.  The  word  akñaram  is  very  significant \r\nbecause this material creation is subject to destruction but the Lord is above \r\nthis material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior \r\nto all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material \r\ncosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme."

This  form  was  glaring  like  the  sun,  and  its \r\nmany faces were rapidly changing.  Kåñëa showed this form just to satisfy the \r\ndesire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by Kåñëa through His \r\ninternal  potency,  which  is  inconceivable by human speculation. No one had \r\nseen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was \r\nshown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets \r\nin  outer  space  could  also  see  it.  They  had  not  seen  it  before,  but  because  of \r\nArjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of \r\nthe  Lord  could  see  the  universal  form  which  was  shown  to  Arjuna  by  the \r\nmercy  of  Kåñëa.  Someone  has  commented  that  this  form  was  shown  to \r\nDuryodhana  also  when  Kåñëa  went  to  Duryodhana  to  negotiate  for  peace. \r\nUnfortunately,  Duryodhana  did  not  accept  the  peace  offer,  but  at  that  time \r\nKåñëa  manifested  some  of  His  universal forms. But those forms are different \r\nfrom this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that no one had ever seen this \r\nform before."

Unless one attains the status of \r\ndivinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It \r\nis stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Viñëu are \r\ndemigods (viñëu-bhaktäù småtä deväù). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not \r\nbelieve  in  Viñëu,  or  who  recognize  only  the  impersonal  part  of  Kåñëa  as  the \r\nSupreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry Kåñëa and \r\nat the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision \r\nwithout  becoming  divine.  In  other  words,  those  who  have  divine  vision  can \r\nalso see like Arjuna. \r\n    The  Bhagavad-gétä  gives  the  description  of  the  universal  form.  Although \r\nthis description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have \r\nsome idea of the viçva-rüpa after this incident.

Veda  refers  to  all  kinds  of  Vedic \r\nliterature,  such  as  the  four  Vedas  (Åg,  Yajur,  Säma  and  Atharva)  and  the \r\neighteen  Puräëas, the  Upaniñads and the  Vedänta-sütra. One can study these \r\nat  home  or  anywhere  else.  Similarly,  there  are  sütras—Kalpa-sütras  and \r\nMémäàsä-sütras—for   studying   the   method   of   sacrifice.  Dänaiù   refers   to \r\ncharity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in \r\nthe   transcendental   loving   service   of   the   Lord—the   brähmaëas   and   the \r\nVaiñëavas.   Similarly,   “pious   activities”   refers   to   the   agni-hotra   and   the \r\nprescribed  duties  of  the  different  castes.  And  the  voluntary  acceptance  of \r\nsome bodily pains is called tapasya. So one can perform all these—can accept \r\nbodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc.—but unless he is a devotee \r\nlike  Arjuna,  it  is  not  possible  to  see  that  universal  form.  Those  who  are \r\nimpersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the \r\nLord,  but  from  Bhagavad-gétä  we  understand  that  the  impersonalists  are  not \r\ndevotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord. \r\n    There  are  many  persons  who  create  incarnations.  They  falsely  claim  an \r\nordinary  human  to  be  an  incarnation,  but  this  is  all  foolishness.  We  should \r\nfollow  the  principles  of  Bhagavad-gétä,  otherwise  there  is  no  possibility  of \r\nattaining  perfect  spiritual  knowledge.  Although  Bhagavad-gétä  is  considered \r\nthe preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables \r\none to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say \r\nthat they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal \r\nform, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one \r\nbecomes a devotee of Kåñëa one cannot see the universal form of God. So one \r\nfirst of all has to become a pure devotee of Kåñëa; then he can claim that he \r\ncan show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of Kåñëa cannot \r\naccept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations."

One may be able to see the universal form of Kåñëa by adding a \r\nlittle tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study \r\nand philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti \r\none cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal \r\nform, the form of Kåñëa with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for \r\ndemigods  like  Brahmä  and  Lord  Çiva.  They  desire  to  see  Him,  and  we  have \r\nevidence in the  Çrémad-Bhägavatam that when He was supposed to be in the \r\nwomb  of  His  mother,  Devaké,  all  the  demigods from heaven came to see the \r\nmarvel of Kåñëa, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was \r\nnot at that time visible to them.

Kåñëa’s \r\nbody,  as  confirmed  by  Brahma-saàhitä  and  confirmed  by  Kåñëa  Himself  in \r\nBhagavad-gétä, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body \r\nis  never  like  a  material  body.  But  for  some  who  make  a  study  of  Kåñëa  by \r\nreading  Bhagavad-gétä or similar Vedic scriptures, Kåñëa is a problem. For one \r\nusing a material process, Kåñëa is considered to be a great historical personality \r\nand very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He \r\nwas so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that \r\nthe   Absolute   Truth   is   impersonal;   therefore   they   think   that   from   His \r\nimpersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. \r\nThis is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is \r\nspeculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on Kåñëa and \r\nconsider  Him  to  be  less  important  than  the  universal  form  of  the  Supreme. \r\nThus  some  think  that  the  universal  form  of  Kåñëa  which  was  manifested  to \r\nArjuna  is  more  important  than  His  personal  form.  According  to  them,  the \r\npersonal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the \r\nultimate  issue,  the  Absolute  Truth  is  not  a  person.  But  the  transcendental \r\nprocess is described in Bhagavad-gétä,  Chapter Four: to hear about Kåñëa from \r\nauthorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the \r\nVedic  line  hear  about  Kåñëa  from  authority,  and  by  repeated  hearing  about \r\nHim, Kåñëa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, Kåñëa is covered \r\nby  His  yoga-mäyä  potency.  He  is  not  to  be  seen  or  revealed  to  anyone  and \r\neveryone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is \r\nconfirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute \r\nTruth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness and by devotional service to Kåñëa, can have his spiritual eyes \r\nopened and can see Kåñëa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even \r\nfor the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand \r\nKåñëa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing Kåñëa in His \r\ntwo-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of \r\nKåñëa is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still"

These  things  are  very  difficult  to \r\nunderstand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it \r\nis clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of \r\nthese  matters.  Those  who,  however,  are  very  experienced  students  of  Vedic \r\nliterature  can  learn  about  Him  from  the  Vedic  literature  in  so  many  ways. \r\nThere are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand \r\nKåñëa, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative \r\nliterature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For \r\nexample, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on Janmäñöamé, \r\nthe  day  on  which  Kåñëa  appeared,  and  on  the  two  days  of  Ekädaçé  (the \r\neleventh day after the new moon and  the eleventh day after the full moon). \r\nAs far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the \r\ndevotees  of  Kåñëa  who  are  engaged  in  His  devotional  service  to  spread  the \r\nKåñëa   philosophy,   or   Kåñëa   consciousness,   throughout   the   world.   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by \r\nRüpa Gosvämé as the most munificent man of charity because love of Kåñëa, \r\nwhich is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives \r\nsome   amount   of   his   money   to   persons   involved   in   distributing   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, that charity, given to spread Kåñëa consciousness, is the greatest \r\ncharity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the \r\ntemples in India there is always some statue, usually of Viñëu or Kåñëa), that is \r\na   chance   to   progress   by   offering   worship   and   respect   to   the   Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, \r\ntemple  worship  is  essential,  and  this  is  confirmed  in  the  Vedic  literature \r\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.23):"

One cannot understand Kåñëa \r\nby mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the \r\nguidance  of  a  bona  fide  spiritual  master,  it  is  impossible  to  even  begin  to \r\nunderstand  Kåñëa.  The  word  tu  is  specifically  used  here  to  indicate  that  no \r\nother  process  can  be  used,  can  be  recommended,  or  can  be  successful  in \r\nunderstanding Kåñëa. \r\n    The  personal  forms  of  Kåñëa,  the  two-handed  form  and  the  four-handed, \r\nare completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. \r\nThe  four-handed  form  of  Näräyaëa  and  the  two-handed  form  of  Kåñëa  are \r\neternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is \r\ntemporary.  The  very  word  sudurdarçam,  meaning  “difficult  to  see,”  suggests \r\nthat  no  one  had  seen  that  universal  form.  It  also  suggests  that  amongst  the \r\ndevotees  there  was  no  necessity  of  showing  it.  That  form  was  exhibited  by \r\nKåñëa  at  the  request  of  Arjuna  so  that  in  the  future,  when  one  represents \r\nhimself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form. \r\n    The  word  na,  used  repeatedly  in  the  previous  verse,  indicates  that  one \r\nshould not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in \r\nVedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of Kåñëa. Only then \r\ncan one attempt to write commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä. \r\n    Kåñëa   changes   from   the   universal   form   to   the   four-handed   form   of \r\nNäräyaëa and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that \r\nthe four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all \r\nemanations   of   the   original   two-handed   Kåñëa.   He   is   the   origin   of   all \r\nemanations.  Kåñëa  is  distinct  even  from  these  forms,  what  to  speak  of  the \r\nimpersonal   conception.   As   far   as   the   four-handed   forms   of   Kåñëa   are \r\nconcerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of \r\nKåñëa (which is known as Mahä-Viñëu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and \r\nfrom  whose  breathing  so  many  innumerable  universes  are  passing  out  and \r\nentering)   is   also   an   expansion   of   the   Supreme   Lord.

He is the cause of all causes.” \r\n    Elsewhere it is said, yaträvatérëaà kåñëäkhyaà paraà brahma naräkåti: “The \r\nSupreme  Absolute  Truth  is  a  person,  His  name  is  Kåñëa,  and  He  sometimes \r\ndescends  on  this  earth.”  Similarly,  in  the  Çrémad-Bhägavatam  we  find  a \r\ndescription   of   all   kinds   of   incarnations   of   the   Supreme   Personality   of \r\nGodhead, and in this list the name of  Kåñëa also appears. But then it is said \r\nthat  this  Kåñëa  is  not  an  incarnation  of  God  but  is  the  original  Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead  Himself  (ete  cäàça-kaläù  puàsaù  kåñëas  tu  bhagavän \r\nsvayam). \r\n    Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says, mattaù parataraà nänyat: “There \r\nis nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead Kåñëa.” He also \r\nsays elsewhere in  Bhagavad-gétä,  aham ädir hi devänäm: “I am the origin of all \r\nthe  demigods.”  And  after  understanding  Bhagavad-gétä  from  Kåñëa,  Arjuna \r\nalso   confirms   this   in   the   following   words:  paraà   brahma   paraà   dhäma \r\npavitram-paramaà bhavän, “I now fully understand that You are the Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of \r\neverything.”  Therefore  the  universal  form  which  Kåñëa  showed  to  Arjuna  is \r\nnot  the  original  form  of  God.  The  original  is  the  Kåñëa  form.  The  universal \r\nform, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to \r\ndraw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God’s original \r\nform. \r\n    The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with \r\nthe  Lord  in  different  transcendental  relationships.  The  Supreme  Godhead \r\nexchanges  transcendental  love  in  His  original  form  of  Kåñëa.  Therefore  to \r\nArjuna, who was so intimately related with Kåñëa in friendship, this form of \r\nthe  universal  manifestation  was  not  pleasing;  rather,  it  was  fearful.  Arjuna, \r\nwho was a constant companion of Kåñëa’s, must have had transcendental eyes; \r\nhe was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal \r\nform. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating \r\nthemselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional \r\nservice the two-handed form of Kåñëa is the most dear."

One may be engaged in various activities, but one should \r\nnot be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for \r\nHim.  For  example,  one  may  be  engaged  in  business,  but  to  transform  that \r\nactivity into Kåñëa consciousness, one has to do business for Kåñëa. If Kåñëa is \r\nthe  proprietor  of  the  business,  then  Kåñëa  should  enjoy  the  profit  of  the \r\nbusiness.  If  a  businessman  is  in  possession  of  thousands  and  thousands  of \r\ndollars, and if he has to offer all this to Kåñëa, he can do it. This is work for \r\nKåñëa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can \r\nconstruct a nice temple for Kåñëa, and he can install the Deity of Kåñëa  and \r\narrange  for  the  Deity’s  service,  as  is  outlined  in  the  authorized  books  of \r\ndevotional service. This is all kåñëa-karma. One should not be attached to the \r\nresult of his work, but the result should be offered to Kåñëa, and one should \r\naccept as prasädam the remnants of offerings to Kåñëa. If one constructs a very \r\nbig  building  for  Kåñëa  and  installs  the  Deity  of  Kåñëa,  one  is  not  prohibited \r\nfrom  living  there,  but  it  is  understood  that  the  proprietor  of  the  building  is \r\nKåñëa.

One  can  sow  tulasé \r\nplants, because  tulasé leaves are very important and Kåñëa has recommended \r\nthis  in  Bhagavad-gétä.  Patraà  puñpaà  phalaà  toyam.  Kåñëa  desires  that  one \r\noffer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water—and by such an \r\noffering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulasé. So one can sow \r\ntulasé and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in \r\nthe service of Kåñëa. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in \r\nworking for Kåñëa. \r\n    The word mat-paramaù refers to one who considers the association of Kåñëa \r\nin His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does \r\nnot  wish  to  be  elevated  to  the  higher  planets  such  as  the  moon  or  sun  or \r\nheavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He \r\nhas  no  attraction  for  that.  He  is  only  attracted  to  being  transferred  to  the \r\nspiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into \r\nthe glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants  to enter the highest spiritual \r\nplanet, namely Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana. He has full knowledge of that \r\nplanet,  and  therefore  he  is  not  interested  in  any  other.  As  indicated  by  the \r\nword  mad-bhaktaù,  he  fully  engages  in  devotional  service,  specifically  in  the \r\nnine  processes  of  devotional  engagement:  hearing,  chanting,  remembering, \r\nworshiping,  serving  the  lotus  feet  of  the  Lord,  offering  prayers,  carrying  out \r\nthe orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything \r\nto Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or \r\nat least in one, and that will surely make one perfect. \r\n    The term saìga-varjitaù is very significant. One should disassociate himself \r\nfrom persons who are against Kåñëa. Not only are the atheistic persons against \r\nKåñëa, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental \r\nspeculation.  Therefore  the  pure  form  of  devotional  service  is  described  in \r\nBhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.1.11) as follows:"

He must be freed from the association of persons who \r\nare  addicted  to  fruitive  activities  and  mental  speculation.  When,  freed  from \r\nsuch  unwanted  association  and  from  the  contamination  of  material  desires, \r\none  favorably  cultivates  knowledge  of  Kåñëa,  that  is  called  pure  devotional \r\nservice.   Änukülyasya   saìkalpaù   prätikülyasya   varjanam   (Hari-bhakti-viläsa \r\n11.676).   One   should   think   of   Kåñëa   and   act   for   Kåñëa   favorably,   not \r\nunfavorably.  Kaàsa  was  an  enemy  of  Kåñëa’s.  From  the  very  beginning  of \r\nKåñëa’s birth, Kaàsa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was \r\nalways  unsuccessful,  he  was  always  thinking  of  Kåñëa.  Thus  while  working, \r\nwhile  eating  and  while  sleeping,  he  was  always  Kåñëa  conscious  in  every \r\nrespect, but that Kåñëa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite \r\nof his always thinking of Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a \r\ndemon, and Kåñëa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by Kåñëa \r\nattains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The \r\npure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred \r\neven to the highest planet, Goloka Våndävana. His only objective is to serve \r\nKåñëa wherever he may be. \r\n    A devotee of Kåñëa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he \r\nhas   no   enemy   (nirvairaù).   How   is   this?   A   devotee   situated   in   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness knows that only devotional service to Kåñëa can relieve a person \r\nfrom all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore \r\nhe  wants  to  introduce  this  system,  Kåñëa  consciousness,  into  human  society. \r\nThere are many examples in history of  devotees of the Lord who risked their \r\nlives  for  the  spreading  of  God  consciousness.  The  favorite  example  is  Lord \r\nJesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for \r\nspreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand \r\nthat  he  was  killed.  Similarly,  in  India  also  there  are  many  examples,  such  as \r\nÖhäkura  Haridäsa  and  Prahläda  Mahäräja.  Why  such  risk?  Because  they \r\nwanted  to  spread  Kåñëa  consciousness,  and  it  is  difficult.  A  Kåñëa  conscious \r\nperson  knows  that  if  a  man  is  suffering  it  is  due  to  his  forgetfulness  of  his \r\neternal relationship with Kåñëa.

In \r\nsuch a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can \r\nimagine  how  merciful  Kåñëa  is  to  those  engaged  in  His   service,  risking \r\neverything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the \r\nsupreme planet after leaving the body. \r\n    In   summary,     the    universal    form    of  Kåñëa,    which     is  a   temporary \r\nmanifestation, and the form of time  which devours everything, and even the \r\nform of Viñëu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kåñëa. Thus Kåñëa is \r\nthe origin of all these manifestations. It is not that Kåñëa is a manifestation of \r\nthe  original  viçva-rüpa,  or  Viñëu.  Kåñëa  is  the  origin  of  all  forms.  There  are \r\nhundreds  and  thousands  of  Viñëus,  but  for  a  devotee  no  form  of  Kåñëa  is \r\nimportant      but   the   original    form,    two-handed       Çyämasundara.       In   the \r\nBrahma-saàhitä it is stated that those who  are attached to the Çyämasundara \r\nform of Kåñëa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and \r\ncannot see anything else.

Those   who   engage   themselves   in   meditation   on   the \r\nimpersonal  Brahman  are  called  impersonalists.  Arjuna  is  here  questioning \r\nwhich  position  is  better.  There  are  different  ways  to  realize  the  Absolute \r\nTruth,  but  Kåñëa  indicates  in  this  chapter  that  bhakti-yoga,  or  devotional \r\nservice to Him, is the highest of all. It  is the most direct, and it is the easiest \r\nmeans for association with the Godhead. \r\n    In the Second Chapter of  Bhagavad-gétä, the Supreme Lord explained that \r\na  living  entity  is  not  the  material  body;  he  is  a  spiritual  spark.  And  the \r\nAbsolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the \r\nliving entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended \r\nthat  he  transfer  his  attention  fully  to  the  whole.  Then  again  in  the  Eighth \r\nChapter it was said that anyone who thinks of Kåñëa at the time of quitting his \r\nbody is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of Kåñëa. And at \r\nthe end of the  Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all  yogés, one who \r\nalways  thinks  of  Kåñëa  within  himself  is  considered  the  most  perfect.  So  in \r\npractically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached \r\nto the personal form of Kåñëa, for that is the highest spiritual realization. \r\n    Nevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of \r\nKåñëa.   They   are   so   firmly   detached   that   even   in   the   preparation   of \r\ncommentaries to  Bhagavad-gétä they want to distract other people from Kåñëa \r\nand  transfer  all  devotion  to  the  impersonal  brahmajyoti.  They  prefer  to \r\nmeditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the \r\nreach of the senses and is not manifest. \r\n    And so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is \r\ntrying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes \r\nis most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is \r\nattached to the personal form of Kåñëa. He is not attached to the impersonal \r\nBrahman.  He  wants  to  know  whether  his  position  is  secure.  The  impersonal \r\nmanifestation,  either  in  this  material  world  or  in  the  spiritual  world  of  the \r\nSupreme  Lord,  is  a  problem  for  meditation.  Actually,  one  cannot  perfectly \r\nconceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna"

This  important  question  asked  of \r\nKåñëa  by  Arjuna  will  clarify  the  distinction  between  the  impersonal  and \r\npersonal conceptions of the Absolute Truth."

The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult \r\nfor him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, \r\nthe bhakti-yogé accepts the Deity of Kåñëa as worshipable because there is some \r\nbodily  conception  fixed  in  the  mind,  which  can  thus  be  applied.  Of  course, \r\nworship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple \r\nis not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may \r\nbe saguëa and nirguëa—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. \r\nWorship  of  the  Deity  in  the  temple  is  saguëa  worship,  for  the  Lord  is \r\nrepresented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented \r\nby material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. \r\nThat is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord. \r\n    A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the \r\nstreet, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their \r\ndestination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation which we may \r\nfind somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the \r\nwork.  Similarly,  God  has  an  authorized  representation  in  the  Deity  form, \r\nwhich   is   called   arcä-vigraha.   This   arcä-vigraha   is   an   incarnation   of   the \r\nSupreme  Lord.  God  will  accept  service  through  that  form.  The  Lord  is \r\nomnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arcä-vigraha He can \r\naccept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in \r\nconditioned life. \r\n    So   for   a   devotee   there   is   no   difficulty   in   approaching   the   Supreme \r\nimmediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way \r\nto  spiritual  realization  the  path  is  difficult.  They  have  to  understand  the \r\nunmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as \r\nthe    Upaniñads,   and   they   have   to   learn   the   language,   understand   the \r\nnonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for \r\na  common  man.  A  person  in  Kåñëa  consciousness,  engaged  in  devotional \r\nservice,  simply  by  the  guidance  of  the  bona  fide  spiritual  master,  simply  by \r\noffering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of \r\nthe Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, \r\nrealizes  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  very  easily.  There  is  no  doubt"

But   the \r\npersonalist,  without  any  risk,  trouble  or  difficulty,  approaches  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality  directly.  A  similar  passage  appears  in  Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  It  is \r\nstated   there   that   if   one   ultimately   has   to   surrender   unto   the   Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called bhakti), but instead \r\ntakes  the  trouble  to  understand  what  is  Brahman  and  what  is  not  Brahman \r\nand  spends  his  whole  life  in  that  way,  the  result  is  simply  troublesome. \r\nTherefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path \r\nof self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result. \r\n    A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into \r\nthe  spiritual  whole,  he  may  accomplish  the  realization  of  the  eternal  and \r\nknowledgeable  aspects  of  his  original  nature,  but  the  blissful  portion  is  not \r\nrealized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned \r\nin  the  process  of  jïäna-yoga,  may  come  to  the  point  of   bhakti-yoga,  or \r\ndevotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a \r\nsource of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied \r\nsoul  is  always  in  difficulty  with  the  unmanifest,  both  at  the  time  of  practice \r\nand at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and \r\none should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the \r\nnature  of  his  spiritual  blissful  self.  One  should  not  take  up  this  process.  For \r\nevery individual living entity the process of Kåñëa consciousness, which entails \r\nfull engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore \r\nthis  devotional  service,  there  is  the  danger  of  turning  to  atheism.  Thus  the \r\nprocess of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which \r\nis beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should \r\nnever  be  encouraged  at  any  time,  especially  in  this  age.  It  is  not  advised  by \r\nLord Kåñëa."

His duty is to render service to the Lord—and if he \r\ndoes not, then he will render service to mäyä. \r\n    As stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional \r\nservice. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully \r\non Kåñëa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kåñëa. It does not \r\nmatter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only \r\nfor  Kåñëa.  That  is  the  standard  of  devotional  service.  The  devotee  does  not \r\ndesire  any  achievement  other  than  pleasing  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead. His life’s mission is to please Kåñëa, and he can sacrifice everything \r\nfor  Kåñëa’s  satisfaction,  just  as  Arjuna  did  in  the  Battle  of  Kurukñetra.

Those  who \r\nare advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet \r\nthey like by the yoga process,  and others take the opportunity in various ways, \r\nbut as far as the devotee is concerned,  it is clearly stated here that the Lord \r\nHimself  takes  him.

But  by  the  practice  of  bhakti-yoga  these  senses  can  become \r\npurified,  and  in  the  purified  state  they  come  directly  in  contact  with  the \r\nSupreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to \r\nsome master, but I don’t really lovingly  serve my master. I simply serve to get \r\nsome money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and \r\npays  me.  So  there  is  no  question  of  love.  But  for  spiritual  life,  one  must  be \r\nelevated  to  the  pure  stage  of  love.  That  stage  of  love  can  be  achieved  by \r\npractice of devotional service, performed with the present senses. \r\n    This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there, \r\nlove of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material \r\nassociation. Now the heart has to be purified of the material association, and \r\nthat  dormant,  natural  love  for  Kåñëa  has  to  be  revived.  That  is  the  whole \r\nprocess. \r\n    To practice the regulative principles of  bhakti-yoga one should, under the \r\nguidance  of  an  expert  spiritual  master,  follow  certain  principles:  one  should \r\nrise  early  in  the  morning,  take  bath,  enter  the  temple  and  offer  prayers  and \r\nchant Hare Kåñëa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to \r\noffer  to  the  Deity,  take  prasädam,  and  so  on.  There  are  various  rules  and \r\nregulations   which   one   should   follow.   And   one   should   constantly   hear \r\nBhagavad-gétä and  Çrémad-Bhägavatam from pure devotees. This practice can \r\nhelp anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress \r\ninto the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules \r\nand regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one \r\nto the stage of love of God."

How to do this work has \r\nalready been explained in the  fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One \r\nshould  be  sympathetic  to  the  propagation  of  Kåñëa  consciousness.  There  are \r\nmany  devotees  who  are  engaged  in  the  propagation  of  Kåñëa  consciousness, \r\nand they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative \r\nprinciples  of  bhakti-yoga,  he  can  try  to  help  such  work.  Every  endeavor \r\nrequires land, capital, organization and labor.

The only difference is that in \r\nmaterialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be \r\nperformed for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has \r\nsufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating \r\nKåñëa  consciousness.  Or  he  can  help  with  publications.  There  are  various \r\nfields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot \r\nsacrifice  the  results  of  his  activities,  the  same  person  can  still  sacrifice  some \r\npercentage  to  propagate  Kåñëa  consciousness.  This  voluntary  service  to  the \r\ncause of Kåñëa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for \r\nGod, whereupon one becomes perfect."

If one attaches himself directly to the activities of \r\nKåñëa consciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many \r\nother  difficulties.  For  one  who  has  such  a  problem,  it  is  advised  that  he \r\nsacrifice  the  accumulated  result  of  his  activities  to  some  good  cause.  Such \r\nprocedures  are  described  in  the  Vedic  rules.  There  are  many  descriptions  of \r\nsacrifices and special functions of puëya, or special work in which the result of \r\none’s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated \r\nto  the  state  of  knowledge.  It  is  also  found  that  when  one  who  is  not  even \r\ninterested  in  the  activities  of  Kåñëa  consciousness  gives  charity  to  some \r\nhospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of \r\nhis activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving \r\nup the fruits of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in \r\nthat    purified    stage   of   mind     one    becomes      able   to   understand       Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness. Of course Kåñëa consciousness is not dependent on any other \r\nexperience,  because  Kåñëa  consciousness  itself  can  purify  one’s  mind,  but  if \r\nthere are impediments to accepting Kåñëa consciousness, one may try to give \r\nup the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, \r\nnational service, sacrifice for one’s country, etc., may be accepted so that some \r\nday one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. \r\nIn Bhagavad-gétä (18.46) we find it is stated, yataù pravåttir bhütänäm: if one \r\ndecides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the \r\nsupreme cause is Kåñëa, he will come gradually to understand that Kåñëa is the \r\nsupreme cause by the sacrificial method."

By  meditation \r\none  can  be  able  to  understand  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  by  a \r\ngradual  process.  There  are  processes  which  make  one  understand  that  one \r\nhimself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable \r\nto engage in devotional service. If one  is not able to meditate in such a way, \r\nthen  there  are  prescribed  duties,  as  enjoined  in  the  Vedic  literature,  for  the \r\nbrähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas and çüdras, which we shall find in the last chapter \r\nof  Bhagavad-gétä.

Devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness is the direct \r\nmethod,   and   the   other   method   involves   renouncing   the   fruits   of   one’s \r\nactivities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of \r\nmeditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the \r\nstage  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  One  may  take  either  the \r\nstep-by-step  process  or  the  direct  path.  The  direct  process  is  not  possible  for \r\neveryone;  therefore  the  indirect  process  is  also  good.  It  is,  however,  to  be \r\nunderstood that the indirect process  is not recommended for Arjuna, because \r\nhe is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is \r\nfor   others,   who   are   not   at   this   stage;   for   them   the   gradual   process   of \r\nrenunciation,  knowledge,  meditation  and  realization  of  the  Supersoul  and \r\nBrahman should be followed.

So it is better to suffer than \r\nto protest.” In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.14.8) it is stated: tat te ’nukampäà \r\nsusamékñamäëo  bhuïjäna  evätma-kåtaà  vipäkam.  Whenever  a  devotee  is  in \r\ndistress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord’s mercy upon \r\nhim.  He  thinks,  “Thanks  to  my  past  misdeeds  I  should  suffer  far,  far  greater \r\nthan I am suffering now.

A devotee is also always kind \r\nto  everyone,  even  to  his  enemy.  Nirmama  means  that  a  devotee  does  not \r\nattach  much  importance  to  the  pains  and  trouble  pertaining  to  the  body \r\nbecause he knows perfectly well that he  is not the material body. He does not \r\nidentify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego \r\nand is equipoised in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied \r\nwith whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor \r\nmuch to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. \r\nHe  is  a  completely  perfect  mystic  because  he  is  fixed  in  the  instructions \r\nreceived from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled he is \r\ndetermined. He is not swayed by false arguments, because no one can lead him \r\nfrom the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that \r\nKåñëa is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All these qualifications \r\nenable  him  to  fix  his  mind  and  intelligence  entirely  on  the  Supreme  Lord. \r\nSuch a standard of devotional service is undoubtedly very rare, but a devotee \r\nbecomes  situated  in  that  stage  by  following  the  regulative  principles  of \r\ndevotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear \r\nto  Him,  for  the  Lord  is  always  pleased  with  all  his  activities  in  full  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness."

In other words, in this chapter it is \r\ndecided  that  through  good  association  one  develops  attachment  for  pure \r\ndevotional service and thereby accepts  a bona fide spiritual master and from \r\nhim   begins   to   hear   and   chant   and   observe  the  regulative  principles  of"

This path is recommended \r\nin this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only \r\nabsolute    path    for  self-realization,    for  the   attainment      of  the   Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute \r\nTruth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one \r\nsurrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not \r\nhave the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception \r\nmay  be  beneficial.  In  the  impersonal  conception  of  the  Absolute  Truth  one \r\nworks    without     fruitive   result,   meditates     and    cultivates   knowledge       to \r\nunderstand  spirit  and  matter.  This  is  necessary  as  long  as  one  is  not  in  the \r\nassociation of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to \r\nengage in Kåñëa consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to \r\nundergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, \r\nas  described  in  the  middle  six  chapters  of  Bhagavad-gétä,  is  more  congenial. \r\nOne need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because \r\nby the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically."

    "text": "Arjuna was inquisitive about prakåti (nature),  puruña (the enjoyer),  kñetra \r\n(the   field),   kñetra-jïa   (its   knower),   and   knowledge   and   the   object   of \r\nknowledge.  When  he  inquired  about  all  these,  Kåñëa  said  that  this  body  is \r\ncalled the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the \r\nfield.   This   body   is   the   field   of   activity   for   the   conditioned   soul.   The \r\nconditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord it \r\nover material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material \r\nnature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is \r\nthe  body?  The  body  is  made  of  senses.  The  conditioned  soul  wants  to  enjoy \r\nsense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, \r\nhe is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called kñetra, or \r\nthe field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person, who should not \r\nidentify himself with the body, is called kñetra-jïa, the knower of the field. It is \r\nnot  very  difficult  to  understand  the  difference  between  the  field  and  its \r\nknower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that \r\nfrom  childhood  to  old  age  he  undergoes  so  many  changes  of  body  and  yet  is \r\nstill one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of \r\nthe  field  of  activities  and  the  actual  field  of  activities.  A  living  conditioned \r\nsoul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in \r\nthe  beginning—dehino  ’smin—that  the  living  entity  is  within  the  body  and \r\nthat  the  body  is  changing  from  childhood  to  boyhood  and  from  boyhood  to \r\nyouth  and  from  youth  to  old  age,  and  the  person  who  owns  the  body  knows \r\nthat  the  body  is  changing.  The  owner  is  distinctly  kñetra-jïa.  Sometimes  we \r\nthink, “I am happy,” “I am a man,” “I am a woman,” “I am a dog,” “I am a cat.” \r\nThese are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different \r\nfrom  the  body.  Although  we  may  use  many  articles—our  clothes,  etc.—we \r\nknow that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand \r\nby  a  little  contemplation  that  we  are  different  from  the  body.  I  or  you  or"

In  the  middle  six  chapters  of  the  Bhagavad-gétä  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and \r\nthe  Supersoul  in  regard  to  devotional  service  are  described.  The  superior \r\nposition of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position \r\nof  the  individual  soul  are  definitely  defined  in  these  chapters.  The  living \r\nentities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they \r\nare   suffering.   When   enlightened   by   pious   activities,   they   approach   the \r\nSupreme  Lord  in  different  capacities—as  the  distressed,  those  in  want  of \r\nmoney,  the  inquisitive,  and  those  in  search  of  knowledge.  That  is  also \r\ndescribed. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity \r\ncomes  into  contact  with  material  nature  and  how  he  is  delivered  by  the \r\nSupreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation \r\nof knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained. Although \r\nthe living entity is completely different from the material body, he somehow \r\nbecomes related. This also is explained."

Because the Supersoul is \r\nthe plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, Kåñëa \r\nsays, “I am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I \r\nam  the  superknower.

The  distinction  between  the \r\nfield  of  activities,  the  knower  of  activities,  and  the  supreme  knower  of \r\nactivities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the \r\nbody,  the  constitution  of  the  individual  soul,  and  the  constitution  of  the \r\nSupersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jïäna. That is the opinion of \r\nKåñëa.  To  understand  both  the  soul  and  the  Supersoul  as  one  yet  distinct  is \r\nknowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower \r\nof activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of \r\nprakåti  (nature),  puruña  (the  enjoyer  of  nature)  and  éçvara  (the  knower  who \r\ndominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse \r\nthe three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the \r\npainting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is \r\nnature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is \r\nthe supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead.

Still,  as  a  matter  of  course,  learned  scholars  and \r\nstandard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. Kåñëa is \r\nexplaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality \r\nof the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Vedänta, which is \r\naccepted as authority. First He says, “This is according to different sages.” As \r\nfar as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyäsadeva (the author of the \r\nVedänta-sütra)  is  a  great  sage,  and  in  the  Vedänta-sütra  duality  is  perfectly \r\nexplained. And Vyäsadeva’s father, Paräçara, is also a great sage, and he writes \r\nin his books of religiosity, aham tvaà ca tathänye. .. “we—you, I and the various \r\nother living entities—are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now \r\nwe are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to \r\nour different  karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the \r\nlower  nature.  The  higher  and  lower  natures  exist  due  to  ignorance  and  are \r\nbeing manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, \r\nwhich is infallible, is uncontaminated  by the three qualities of nature and is \r\ntranscendental.”  Similarly,  in  the  original  Vedas,  a  distinction  between  the \r\nsoul,  the  Supersoul  and  the  body  is  made,  especially  in  the  Kaöha  Upaniñad. \r\nThere   are   many   great   sages   who   have   explained   this,   and   Paräçara   is \r\nconsidered principal among them. \r\n    The word chandobhiù refers to the various Vedic literatures.

As stated \r\nin   the  Taittiréya   Upaniñad   (2.9),   brahma   pucchaà   pratiñöhä.   There   is   a \r\nmanifestation of the Supreme Lord’s energy known as anna-maya, dependence \r\nupon  food  for  existence.  This  is  a  materialistic  realization  of  the  Supreme. \r\nThen, in präëa-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one \r\ncan  realize  the  Absolute  Truth  in  the  living  symptoms  or  life  forms.  In \r\njïäna-maya,  realization  extends  beyond  the  living  symptoms  to  the  point  of \r\nthinking,  feeling  and  willing.  Then  there  is  Brahman  realization,  called \r\nvijïäna-maya,   in   which   the   living   entity’s   mind   and   life   symptoms   are \r\ndistinguished  from  the  living  entity  himself.  The  next  and  supreme  stage  is \r\nänanda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of \r\nBrahman realization, which are called brahma puccham. Out of these, the first \r\nthree—anna-maya,           präëa-maya       and     jïäna-maya—involve            the   fields   of \r\nactivities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is \r\nthe   Supreme   Lord,   who   is   called   änanda-maya.   The   Vedänta-sütra   also \r\ndescribes     the   Supreme       by   saying,    änanda-mayo        ’bhyäsät:    the    Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead is by nature full  of joy. To enjoy His transcendental \r\nbliss, He expands into vijïäna-maya, präëa-maya, jïäna-maya and anna-maya. \r\nIn the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and \r\ndifferent  from  him  is  the  änanda-maya.  That  means  that  if  the  living  entity \r\ndecides  to  enjoy  in  dovetailing  himself  with  the  änanda-maya,  then  he \r\nbecomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme \r\nknower  of  the  field,  the  living  entity  as  the  subordinate  knower,  and  the \r\nnature  of  the  field  of  activities.  One  has  to  search  for  this  truth  in  the \r\nVedänta-sütra, or Brahma-sütra. \r\n    It  is  mentioned  here  that  the  codes  of  the  Brahma-sütra  are  very  nicely \r\narranged according to cause and effect. Some of the sütras, or aphorisms, are \r\nna  viyad  açruteù  (2.3.2),  nätmä  çruteù  (2.3.18),  and  parät  tu  tac-chruteù \r\n(2.3.40).   The   first   aphorism   indicates   the   field   of   activities,   the   second \r\nindicates  the  living  entity,  and  the  third  indicates  the  Supreme  Lord,  the \r\nsummum bonum among all the manifestations of various entities."

    "text": "From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns \r\nand the aphorisms of the Vedänta-sütra, the components of this world can be \r\nunderstood as follows. First there are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are \r\nthe  five  great  elements  (mahä-bhüta).  Then  there  are  false  ego,  intelligence \r\nand the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature. Then there are five \r\nsenses  for  acquiring  knowledge:  the  eyes,  ears,  nose,  tongue  and  skin.  Then \r\nfive  working  senses:  voice,  legs,  hands,  anus  and  genitals.  Then,  above  the \r\nsenses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense \r\nwithin.  Therefore,  including  the  mind,  there  are  eleven  senses  altogether. \r\nThen  there  are  the  five  objects  of  the  senses:  smell,  taste,  form,  touch  and \r\nsound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of \r\nactivity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he \r\ncan very well understand the field of activity. Then there are desire, hatred, \r\nhappiness and distress, which are interactions, representations of the five great \r\nelements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness \r\nand  conviction,  are  the  manifestation  of  the  subtle  body—mind,  ego  and \r\nintelligence. These subtle elements are included within the field of activities. \r\n    The five great elements are a gross representation of the false ego, which in \r\nturn represents the primal stage of false ego technically called the materialistic \r\nconception,      or   tämasa-buddhi,      intelligence     in   ignorance.      This,   further, \r\nrepresents the unmanifested stage of the three modes of material nature. The \r\nunmanifested modes of material nature are called pradhäna. \r\n    One  who  desires  to  know  the  twenty-four  elements  in  detail  along  with \r\ntheir interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-gétä, \r\na summary only is given. \r\n    The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of \r\nthe  body,  which  are  six  in  number:  the  body  is  born,  it  grows,  it  stays,  it \r\nproduces by-products, then it begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes. \r\nTherefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the kñetra-jïa,"

But actually this is the real \r\nprocess  of  knowledge.  If  one  accepts  this  process,  then  the  possibility  of \r\napproaching  the  Absolute  Truth  exists.  This  is  not  the  interaction  of  the \r\ntwenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out \r\nof the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the \r\nbody, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of \r\nknowledge  as  described  here  is  the  means  to  get  out  of  it.  Of  all  the \r\ndescriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described \r\nin   the   first  line   of   the   eleventh     verse.    Mayi    cänanya-yogena       bhaktir \r\navyabhicäriëé:  the  process  of  knowledge  terminates  in  unalloyed  devotional \r\nservice to the Lord.

    "text": "Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved. \r\n﻿accepting  a  spiritual  master,  as  mentioned  in  the  eighth  verse,  is  essential. \r\nEven   for   one   who   takes   to   devotional   service,   it   is   most   important. \r\nTranscendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The \r\nSupreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  Çré  Kåñëa,  clearly  states  here  that  this \r\nprocess  of  knowledge  is  the  actual  path.  Anything  speculated  beyond  this  is \r\nnonsense. \r\n    As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows. \r\nHumility  means  that  one  should  not  be  anxious  to  have  the  satisfaction  of \r\nbeing honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager \r\nto receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect \r\nknowledge—who   knows   that   he   is   not   this   body—anything,   honor   or \r\ndishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after \r\nthis material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, \r\nand  consequently  sometimes  it  is  found  that  without  understanding  the \r\nprinciples  of  religion  one  enters  into  some  group  which  is  not  actually \r\nfollowing religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious \r\nmentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test \r\nto see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items. \r\n    Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, \r\nbut  actually  nonviolence  means  not  to  put  others  into  distress.  People  in \r\ngeneral  are  trapped  by  ignorance  in  the  material  concept  of  life,  and  they \r\nperpetually  suffer  material  pains.  So  unless  one  elevates  people  to  spiritual \r\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real \r\nknowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this \r\nmaterial entanglement. That is nonviolence. \r\n    Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor \r\nfrom  others.  If  one  is  engaged  in  the  advancement  of  spiritual  knowledge, \r\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected \r\nbecause material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only \r\nfive  years  old,  was  engaged  in  the  cultivation  of  spiritual  knowledge,  was \r\nendangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father \r\ntried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be \r\nmany  impediments  to  making  advancement  in  spiritual  knowledge,  but  we"

All Rights Reserved. \r\n﻿should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination. \r\n    Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward \r\nthat he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the \r\nspiritual  master,  that  is  essential,  because  without  the  instruction  of  a  bona \r\nfide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should \r\napproach  the  spiritual  master  with  all  humility  and  offer  him  all  services  so \r\nthat  he  will  be  pleased  to  bestow  his  blessings  upon  the  disciple.  Because  a \r\nbona  fide  spiritual  master  is  a  representative  of  Kåñëa,  if  he  bestows  any \r\nblessings upon his disciple, that will  make the disciple immediately advanced \r\nwithout  the  disciple’s  following  the  regulative  principles.  Or,  the  regulative \r\nprinciples  will  be  easier  for  one  who  has  served  the  spiritual  master  without \r\nreservation. \r\n    Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are \r\ntwo  kinds  of  cleanliness:  external  and  internal.  External  cleanliness  means \r\ntaking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kåñëa always and \r\nchant  Hare  Kåñëa,  Hare  Kåñëa,  Kåñëa  Kåñëa,  Hare  Hare/  Hare  Räma,  Hare \r\nRäma,  Räma  Räma,  Hare  Hare.  This  process  cleans  the  accumulated  dust  of \r\npast karma from the mind. \r\n    Steadiness means that one should be  very determined to make progress in \r\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress. \r\nAnd   self-control   means   that   one   should   not   accept   anything   which   is \r\ndetrimental to the path of spiritual  progress. One should become accustomed \r\nto this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This \r\nis real renunciation. The senses are so  strong that they are always anxious to \r\nhave sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not \r\nnecessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one \r\ncan discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and \r\nuncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is \r\nevery possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is \r\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should \r\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and \r\nchanting  Hare  Kåñëa.  As  far  as  the  eyes  are  concerned,  they  should  not  be \r\nallowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kåñëa. That will control the"

Similarly,  the  ears  should  be  engaged  in  hearing  about  Kåñëa  and  the \r\nnose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional \r\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä is simply expounding the \r\nscience   of   devotional   service.   Devotional   service   is   the   main   and   sole \r\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the  Bhagavad-gétä try to divert the \r\nmind  of  the  reader  to  other  subjects,  but  there  is  no  other  subject  in \r\nBhagavad-gétä than devotional service. \r\n    False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that \r\nhe is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False \r\nego  is  condemned,  but  not  real  ego.  In  the  Vedic  literature  (Båhad-äraëyaka \r\nUpaniñad  1.4.10) it is said, ahaà brahmäsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I \r\nam,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This \r\nsense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body \r\nit  is  false  ego.  When  the  sense  of  self  is  applied  to  reality,  that  is  real  ego. \r\nThere are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot \r\ngive up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up \r\nthe false identification with the body. \r\n    One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age \r\nand disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam the world of the unborn, the  child’s stay in the womb of \r\nthe mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be \r\nthoroughly  understood  that  birth  is  distressful.  Because  we  forget  how  much \r\ndistress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any \r\nsolution  to  the  repetition  of  birth  and  death.  Similarly  at  the  time  of  death \r\nthere   are   all   kinds   of   sufferings,   and   they   are   also   mentioned   in   the \r\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and \r\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be \r\ndiseased,  and  no  one  wants  to  become  old,  but  there  is  no  avoiding  these. \r\nUnless  we  have  a  pessimistic  view  of  this  material  life,  considering  the \r\ndistresses  of  birth,  death,  old  age  and  disease,  there  is  no  impetus  for  our \r\nmaking advancement in spiritual life. \r\n    As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one \r\nshould  have  no  feeling  for  these.  They  are  natural  objects  of  affection.  But"

The  best  process  for  making  the  home  pleasant  is  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness. If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very \r\nhappy, because this process of Kåñëa consciousness is very easy. One need only \r\nchant  Hare  Kåñëa,  Hare  Kåñëa,  Kåñëa  Kåñëa,  Hare  Hare/  Hare  Räma,  Hare \r\nRäma,  Räma  Räma,  Hare  Hare,  accept  the  remnants  of  foodstuffs  offered  to \r\nKåñëa,      have     some      discussion       on    books      like    Bhagavad-gétä        and \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam,  and  engage  oneself  in  Deity  worship.  These  four  things \r\nwill make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way. \r\nThe  family  members  can  sit  down  morning  and  evening  and  chant  together \r\nHare  Kåñëa,  Hare  Kåñëa,  Kåñëa  Kåñëa,  Hare  Hare/  Hare  Räma,  Hare  Räma, \r\nRäma Räma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop \r\nKåñëa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to \r\nchange  from  family  life  to  renounced  life.  But  if  it  is  not  congenial,  not \r\nfavorable  for  spiritual  advancement,  then  family  life  should  be  abandoned. \r\nOne  must  sacrifice  everything  to  realize  or  serve  Kåñëa,  just  as  Arjuna  did. \r\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that \r\nthese family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted \r\nthe instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be \r\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world \r\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable. \r\n    Happiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should \r\nlearn  to  tolerate,  as  advised  in  Bhagavad-gétä.  One  can  never  restrict  the \r\ncoming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from \r\nthe  materialistic  way  of  life  and  be  automatically  equipoised  in  both  cases. \r\nGenerally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we \r\nget  something  undesirable  we  are  distressed.  But  if  we  are  actually  in  the \r\nspiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have \r\nto   practice   unbreakable   devotional   service.   Devotional   service   to   Kåñëa \r\nwithout deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional \r\nservice—chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc.—as described in \r\nthe last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed. \r\n    Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want"

One may test \r\nhimself  by  seeing  how  far  he  is  inclined  to  live  in  a  solitary  place,  without \r\nunwanted   association.   Naturally   a   devotee   has   no   taste   for   unnecessary \r\nsporting   or   cinema-going   or   enjoying   some   social   function,   because   he \r\nunderstands  that  these  are  simply  a  waste  of  time.  There  are  many  research \r\nscholars  and  philosophers  who  study  sex  life  or  some  other  subject,  but \r\naccording to  Bhagavad-gétä such research work and philosophical speculation \r\nhave no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to  Bhagavad-gétä, \r\none should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the \r\nsoul. One should make research to understand the self. That is recommended \r\nhere. \r\n    As   far   as   self-realization   is   concerned,   it   is   clearly   stated   here   that \r\nbhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion, \r\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual \r\nsoul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the \r\nbhakti  conception,  the  devotional  conception  of  life.  This  service  of  the \r\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. So \r\nbhakti,  or  devotional  service,  is  eternal.  One  should  be  established  in  that \r\nphilosophical conviction. \r\n    In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas \r\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute \r\nTruth  know  that  the  Self  is  realized  in  three  different  phases,  as  Brahman, \r\nParamätmä and Bhagavän.” Bhagavän is the last word in the realization of the \r\nAbsolute      Truth;    therefore     one    should     reach    up    to   that   platform     of \r\nunderstanding  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  and  thus  engage  in  the \r\ndevotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge. \r\n    Beginning  from  practicing  humility  up  to  the  point  of  realization  of  the \r\nSupreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a \r\nstaircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor. Now \r\non this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the \r\nsecond or the third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is \r\nthe  understanding  of  Kåñëa,  he  is  at  a  lower  stage  of  knowledge.

It  is  clearly  stated  that  without \r\nhumility,  understanding  is  not  truly  possible.  To  think  oneself  God  is  most \r\npuffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent \r\nlaws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. The \r\nbeginning  of  knowledge,  therefore,  is  amänitva,  humility.  One  should  be \r\nhumble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion \r\nagainst the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One \r\nmust know and be convinced of this truth."

Now He begins to explain the knowable, first the soul and then the \r\nSupersoul. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one \r\ncan relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living \r\nentity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which \r\nthe  jéva  was  born.  Nor  can  anyone  trace  out  the  history  of  the  jévätmä’s \r\nmanifestation  from  the  Supreme  Lord.  Therefore  it  is  beginningless.  The \r\nVedic  literature  confirms  this:  na  jäyate  mriyate  vä  vipaçcit  (Kaöha  Upaniñad \r\n1.2.18). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of \r\nknowledge. \r\n    The  Supreme  Lord  as  the  Supersoul  is  also  stated  in  the  Vedic  literature \r\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.16) to be pradhäna-kñetrajïa-patir guëeçaù, the chief \r\nknower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature. In \r\nthe  småti  it  is  said,  däsa-bhüto  harer  eva  nänyasvaiva  kadäcana.  The  living \r\nentities   are   eternally   in   the   service   of   the   Supreme   Lord.   This   is   also \r\nconfirmed  by  Lord  Caitanya  in  His  teachings.  Therefore  the  description  of \r\nBrahman  mentioned  in  this  verse  is  in  relation  to  the  individual  soul,  and \r\nwhen the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood \r\nthat he is vijïäna-brahma as opposed to änanda-brahma. Änanda-brahma is the \r\nSupreme Brahman Personality of Godhead."

He exists in His all-pervading form, and in \r\nHim  exist  all  the  individual  living  entities,  beginning  from  the  first  great \r\nteacher,  Brahmä,  down  to  the  small  ants.  There  are  unlimited  heads,  legs, \r\nhands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the \r\nSupersoul.  Therefore  the  Supersoul  is  all-pervading.  The  individual  soul, \r\nhowever, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is \r\nnot  possible.  If  he  thinks  that  under  ignorance  he  is  not  conscious  that  his \r\nhands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge \r\nhe will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the \r\nindividual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. \r\nThe  Supreme  is  different  from  the  individual  soul.  The  Supreme  Lord  can \r\nextend  His  hand  without  limit;  the  individual  soul  cannot.  In  Bhagavad-gétä \r\nthe Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He \r\naccepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things?

The   Supreme   Lord’s   senses   are   not   so   covered.   His   senses   are \r\ntranscendental  and  are  therefore  called  nirguëa.  Guëa  means  the  material \r\nmodes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood \r\nthat His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our \r\nsensory      activities,    He     has    His     transcendental        senses,    which      are \r\nuncontaminated.  This  is  very  nicely  explained  in  the  Çvetäçvatara  Upaniñad \r\n(3.19)  in  the  verse  apäëi-pädo  javano  grahétä.  The  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead  has  no  hands  which  are  materially  contaminated,  but  He  has  His \r\nhands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction \r\nbetween the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but \r\nHe has eyes—otherwise how could He see? He sees everything—past, present \r\nand future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what \r\nwe have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in \r\nthe future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä: He knows everything, but \r\nno one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He \r\ncan travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the \r\nLord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and \r\nbecause we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. \r\nBut His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature. \r\n    Bhagavad-gétä also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is \r\nby  His  internal  potency.  He  is  not  contaminated  by  the  material  energy, \r\nbecause He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that \r\nHis    whole    embodiment        is  spiritual.    He    has   His    eternal    form,    called \r\nsac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor \r\nof all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full \r\nof knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead.  He  is  the  maintainer  of  all  living  entities  and  the  witness  of  all \r\nactivity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord \r\nis always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs, \r\nHe has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can \r\nsee the Lord’s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His \r\nform.  Therefore  the  impersonalists,  who  are  still  materially  affected,  cannot"

The example is given of \r\nthe sun: The sun, at the meridian, is situated in its place. But if one goes for \r\nfive  thousand  miles  in  all  directions  and  asks,  “Where  is  the  sun?”  everyone \r\nwill say that it is shining on his head.  In the Vedic literature this example is \r\ngiven to show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also \r\nit  is  said  in  Vedic  literature  that  one  Viñëu  is  present  everywhere  by  His \r\nomnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the \r\nSupreme   Lord,   although   the   maintainer   of   every   living   entity,   devours \r\neverything  at  the  time  of  annihilation.  This  was  confirmed  in  the  Eleventh \r\nChapter  when  the  Lord  said  that  He  had  come  to  devour  all  the  warriors \r\nassembled  at  Kurukñetra.  He  also  mentioned  that  in  the  form  of  time  He \r\ndevours also. He is the annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He \r\ndevelops  all  from  their  original  state,  and  at  the  time  of  annihilation  He \r\ndevours them. The Vedic hymns confirm the  fact that He is the origin of all \r\nliving  entities  and  the  rest  of  all.  After  creation,  everything  rests  in  His \r\nomnipotence, and after annihilation everything again returns to rest in Him. \r\nThese  are  the  confirmations  of  Vedic  hymns.

In   the   material   world   that \r\nbrahmajyoti, the Lord’s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the \r\nmaterial elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of \r\nsun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need \r\nof such things. It is clearly stated in  the Vedic literature that because of His \r\nluminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His \r\nsituation  is  not  in  the  material  world.  He  is  situated  in  the  spiritual  world, \r\nwhich is far, far away in the spiritual sky.

Combined,  these  are  called  vijïäna,  or  the  science  of  knowledge. \r\nPerfect  knowledge  can  be  understood  by  the  unalloyed  devotees  of  the  Lord \r\ndirectly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate \r\nstage  these  three  items  become  one,  but  the  devotees  do  not  accept  this. \r\nKnowledge  and  development  of  knowledge  mean  understanding  oneself  in \r\nKåñëa consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon \r\nas we transfer all consciousness to Kåñëa’s activities and realize that Kåñëa is \r\neverything,  then  we  attain  real  knowledge.  In  other  words,  knowledge  is \r\nnothing   but   the   preliminary   stage   of   understanding   devotional   service \r\nperfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained. \r\n    Now,  to  summarize,  one  may  understand  that  verses  6  and  7,  beginning \r\nfrom mahä-bhütäni and continuing through cetanä dhåtiù, analyze the material \r\nelements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to \r\nform  the  body,  or  the  field  of  activities.  And  verses  8  through  12,  from \r\namänitvam       through     tattva-jïänärtha-darçanam,          describe    the    process    of \r\nknowledge  for  understanding  both  types  of  knower  of  the  field  of  activities, \r\nnamely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18, beginning from \r\nanädi mat-param and continuing through  hådi sarvasya viñöhitam, describe the \r\nsoul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul. \r\n    Thus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the \r\nprocess of understanding, and both the soul and the Supersoul. It is especially \r\ndescribed  here  that  only  the  unalloyed  devotees  of  the  Lord  can  understand \r\nthese three items clearly. So for these devotees Bhagavad-gétä is fully useful; it \r\nis  they  who  can  attain  the  supreme  goal,  the  nature  of  the  Supreme  Lord, \r\nKåñëa.   In   other   words,   only   devotees,   and   not   others,   can   understand \r\nBhagavad-gétä and derive the desired result."

The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul \r\nis in the category of His personal expansion. \r\n    Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that \r\nthey existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy \r\nof the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities \r\nare of the superior energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed \r\nbefore  this  cosmos  was  manifested.  Material  nature  was  absorbed  in  the \r\nSupreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  Mahä-Viñëu,  and  when  it  was  required,  it \r\nwas manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are \r\nalso in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are averse to serving the \r\nSupreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But \r\nwith the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a \r\nchance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the \r\nspiritual  world.  That  is  the  mystery  of  this  material  creation.  Actually  the \r\nliving entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but \r\ndue to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really \r\ndoes not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme \r\nLord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead  knows,  however,  how  and  why  this  actually  took  place.  In  the \r\nscriptures  the  Lord  says  that  those  attracted  by  this  material  nature  are \r\nundergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty \r\nfrom   the   descriptions   of   these   few   verses   that   all   transformations   and \r\ninfluences  of  material  nature  by  the  three  modes  are  also  productions  of \r\nmaterial  nature.

There  are  8,400,000 different species of life, and \r\nthese  varieties  are  creations  of  the  material  nature.  They  arise  from  the \r\ndifferent sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this \r\nbody or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of \r\nhappiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, \r\nand not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; \r\ntherefore  that  is  his  real  state.  Because  of  the  desire  to  lord  it  over  material \r\nnature,  he  is  in  the  material  world.  In  the  spiritual  world  there  is  no  such \r\nthing.  The  spiritual  world  is  pure,  but  in  the  material  world  everyone  is \r\nstruggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be \r\nmore  clear  to  state  that  this  body  is  the  effect  of  the  senses.  The  senses  are \r\ninstruments  for  gratifying  desire.  Now,  the  sum  total—body  and  instrument \r\nsenses—are offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse, \r\nthe living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past \r\ndesire and activity.

The being himself is the cause of his \r\nattaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. \r\nOnce placed in some particular kind  of body, he comes under the control of \r\nnature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At \r\nthat time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity \r\nis put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he \r\nmust act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the  living entity is put \r\ninto  the  body  of  a  hog,  then  he  is  forced  to  eat  stool  and  act  like  a  hog. \r\nSimilarly,  if  the  living  entity  is  put  into  the  body  of  a  demigod,  he  must  act \r\naccording to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the \r\nSupersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas (Muëòaka \r\nUpaniñad 3.1.1) as follows: dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyaù. The Supreme Lord is so \r\nkind  upon  the  living  entity  that  He  always  accompanies  the  individual  soul \r\nand in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul, or Paramätmä."

    "text": "This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities \r\ntransmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter \r\nthat the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one \r\nchanges  dress.  This  change  of  dress  is  due  to  his  attachment  to  material \r\nexistence.  As  long  as  he  is  captivated  by  this  false  manifestation,  he  has  to \r\ncontinue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it \r\nover material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the \r\ninfluence  of  material  desire,  the  entity  is  born  sometimes  as  a  demigod, \r\nsometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as \r\na  saintly  man,  as  a  bug.  This  is  going  on.  And  in  all  cases  the  living  entity \r\nthinks  himself  to  be  the  master  of  his  circumstances,  yet  he  is  under  the \r\ninfluence of material nature. \r\n    How  he  is  put  into  such  different  bodies  is  explained  here.  It  is  due  to \r\nassociation  with  the  different  modes  of  nature.  One  has  to  rise,  therefore, \r\nabove  the  three  material  modes  and  become  situated  in  the  transcendental \r\nposition. That is called Kåñëa consciousness. Unless one is situated in Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one \r\nbody to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he \r\nhas to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing \r\nfrom  authoritative  sources.  The  best  example  is  here:  Arjuna  is  hearing  the \r\nscience  of  God  from  Kåñëa.  The  living  entity,  if  he  submits  to  this  hearing \r\nprocess,  will  lose  his  long-cherished  desire  to  dominate  material  nature,  and \r\ngradually  and  proportionately,  as  he  reduces  his  long  desire  to  dominate,  he \r\ncomes  to  enjoy  spiritual  happiness.  In  a  Vedic  mantra  it  is  said  that  as  he \r\nbecomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he"

It  is  distinctly \r\nclear   that   the   ätmä   and   Paramätmä   are   different.   The   Supersoul,   the \r\nParamätmä, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. \r\nAnd  because  the  Paramätmä  is  the  Supreme  Lord,  He  is  present  within  to \r\nsanction   the   individual   soul’s   desiring   material   enjoyment.   Without   the \r\nsanction  of  the  Supreme  Soul,  the  individual  soul  cannot  do  anything.  The \r\nindividual   is   bhukta,   or   the   sustained,   and   the   Lord   is   bhoktä,   or   the \r\nmaintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them \r\nas a friend. \r\n    The fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of \r\nthe Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But \r\nthe living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord \r\nand act independently in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has \r\nthis tendency he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living \r\nentity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy. \r\nAs long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his \r\nfriend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual \r\nenergy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but \r\ndue to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting \r\nthe association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of \r\nhis  material  strife  in  the  conditioned  nature.  The  Lord,  therefore,  is  always \r\ngiving  instruction  from  within  and  from  without.  From  without  He  gives \r\ninstructions as stated in  Bhagavad-gétä, and from within He tries to convince \r\nthe living entity that his activities in the material field are not conducive to \r\nreal happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be \r\nhappy,”  He  says.  Thus  the  intelligent  person  who  places  his  faith  in  the \r\nParamätmä or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward \r\na blissful eternal life of knowledge."

Of course there are those who try to understand the \r\nSupreme  Absolute  Truth  by  cultivation  of  knowledge,  and  they  can  be \r\ncounted  in  the  class  of  the  faithful.  The  Säìkhya  philosophers  analyze  this \r\nmaterial world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as \r\nthe  twenty-fifth  item.  When  they  are  able  to  understand  the  nature  of  the \r\nindividual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to \r\nunderstand   also   that   above   the   individual   soul   there   is   the   Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead.

Similarly,  there  are  others  who  also  try  to  understand  the  Supreme \r\nSoul  by  cultivation  of  knowledge,  and  there  are  others  who  cultivate  the \r\nhaöha-yoga system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead \r\nby childish activities."

As the sun is situated in one \r\nplace but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit soul, \r\nalthough situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by \r\nconsciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as \r\nsunshine  or  light  is  the  proof  of  the  presence  of  the  sun.  When  the  soul  is \r\npresent in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the \r\nsoul  has  passed  from  the  body  there  is  no  more  consciousness.  This  can  be \r\neasily  understood  by  any  intelligent  man.  Therefore  consciousness  is  not  a \r\nproduct of the combinations of matter. It is the symptom of the living entity. \r\nThe  consciousness  of  the  living  entity,  although  qualitatively  one  with  the \r\nsupreme  consciousness,  is  not  supreme,  because  the  consciousness  of  one \r\nparticular body does not share that of another body. But the Supersoul, which \r\nis situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all \r\nbodies. That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual \r\nconsciousness."

This \r\ncombination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the \r\nSupreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic \r\nmanifestation; and that total substance  of the material cause, in which there \r\nare  three  modes  of  nature,  is  sometimes  called  Brahman.  The  Supreme \r\nPersonality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes \r\nbecome possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as \r\nBrahman  in  the  Vedic  literature  (Muëòaka  Upaniñad  1.1.19):  tasmäd  etad \r\nbrahma näma-rüpam annaà ca jäyate. The Supreme Person impregnates that \r\nBrahman  with  the  seeds  of  the  living  entities.  The  twenty-four  elements, \r\nbeginning  from  earth,  water,  fire  and  air,  are  all  material  energy,  and  they \r\nconstitute  what  is  called  mahad  brahma,  or  the  great  Brahman,  the  material \r\nnature.  As  explained  in  the  Seventh  Chapter,  beyond  this  there  is  another, \r\nsuperior nature—the living entity. Into material nature the superior nature is \r\nmixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all \r\nliving entities are born of this material nature. \r\n    The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of  rice, and sometimes it is said that the \r\nscorpion  is  born  out  of  rice.

How  they  are  differently  conditioned  is  explained  in  this  section  of \r\nBhagavad-gétä.   The   mode   of   goodness   is   first   considered.   The   effect   of \r\ndeveloping  the  mode  of  goodness  in  the  material  world  is  that  one  becomes \r\nwiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not \r\nso much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in \r\nmaterial knowledge. The representative type is the brähmaëa, who is supposed \r\nto  be  situated  in  the  mode  of  goodness.  This  sense  of  happiness  is  due  to \r\nunderstanding  that,  in  the  mode  of  goodness,  one  is  more  or  less  free  from \r\nsinful  reactions.  Actually,  in  the  Vedic  literature  it  is  said  that  the  mode  of \r\ngoodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness. \r\n    The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of \r\ngoodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and \r\nis better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples \r\nare the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and \r\nbecause  they  generally  improve  their  living  conditions,  they  feel  a  sort  of \r\nmaterial  happiness.  This  sense  of  advanced  happiness  in  conditioned  life \r\nmakes them bound by the mode of goodness of material  nature. As such, they \r\nare  attracted  toward  working  in  the  mode  of  goodness,  and,  as  long  as  they \r\nhave  an  attraction  for  working  in  that  way,  they  have  to  take  some  type  of \r\nbody in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of \r\nbeing   transferred   to   the   spiritual   world.   Repeatedly   one   may   become   a \r\nphilosopher, a scientist or a poet, and repeatedly become entangled in the same \r\ndisadvantages  of  birth  and  death.  But,  due  to  the  illusion  of  the  material \r\nenergy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant."

And when the mode of passion is increased, \r\none develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense \r\ngratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some \r\nhonor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with \r\nnice children, wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. \r\nAs  long  as  one  is  hankering  after  these  things,  he  has  to  work  very  hard. \r\nTherefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of \r\nhis activities and thus becomes bound by such activities.

Then Arjuna inquires of the means \r\nby  which  he  can  attain  the  transcendental  nature.  That  is  very  important. \r\nUnless  one  knows  the  direct  means  by  which  one  can  be  situated  always \r\ntranscendentally, there is no possibility of showing the symptoms. So all these \r\nquestions put by Arjuna are very important, and the Lord answers them."

    "text": "Arjuna submitted three different questions, and the Lord answers them one \r\nafter    another.     In   these    verses,    Kåñëa     first  indicates     that    a   person \r\ntranscendentally  situated  has  no  envy  and  does  not  hanker  for  anything. \r\nWhen  a  living  entity  stays  in  this  material  world  embodied  by  the  material \r\nbody, it is to be understood that he  is under the control of one of the three \r\nmodes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out \r\nof the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of \r\nthe  material  body,  he  should  be  neutral.  He  should  engage  himself  in  the \r\ndevotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will \r\nautomatically  be  forgotten.  When  one  is  conscious  of  the  material  body,  he \r\nacts only for  sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to \r\nKåñëa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material \r\nbody, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The \r\nqualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is \r\naloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to \r\nenjoy  the  body,  nor  does  he  desire  to  get  out  of  it.  Thus  transcendentally \r\nsituated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He  need not try to become \r\nfree from the influence of the modes of material nature. \r\n    The  next  question  concerns  the  dealings  of  a  transcendentally  situated \r\nperson.  The  materially  situated  person  is  affected  by  so-called  honor  and \r\ndishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not \r\naffected  by  such  false  honor  and  dishonor.  He  performs  his  duty  in  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He \r\naccepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise \r\nhe  has  no  necessity  of  anything  material,  either  a  stone  or  gold.  He  takes \r\neveryone   as   his   dear   friend   who   helps   him   in   his   execution   of   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed \r\nand sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he \r\nhas  nothing  to  do  with  material  existence.  Social  and  political  issues  do  not \r\naffect  him,  because  he  knows  the  situation  of  temporary  upheavals  and \r\ndisturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt"

One should not \r\nbe  disturbed  by  the  activities  of  the  modes  of  nature;  instead  of  putting  his \r\nconsciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kåñëa \r\nactivities.

One who is engaged in \r\nthe  service  of  any  of  the  forms  of  Kåñëa,  or  of  His  plenary  expansions,  is \r\nconsidered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the \r\nforms of Kåñëa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. \r\nSuch  personalities  of  Godhead  are  omnipotent  and  omniscient,  and  they \r\npossess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of \r\nKåñëa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these \r\nmodes  of  material  nature  are  very  difficult  to  overcome,  one  can  overcome \r\nthem  easily.  This  has  already  been  explained  in  the  Seventh  Chapter.  One \r\nwho surrenders unto Kåñëa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of \r\nmaterial nature. To be in Kåñëa consciousness or in devotional service means \r\nto  acquire  equality  with  Kåñëa.  The  Lord  says  that  His  nature  is  eternal, \r\nblissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the \r\nSupreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity, in his \r\nspiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as Kåñëa in quality. The difference \r\nof   individuality     continues,     otherwise      there    would     be   no    question    of \r\nbhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and \r\nthe  activity  of  exchange  of  love  between  the  Lord  and  the  devotee  is  there. \r\nTherefore   the   individuality   of   two   persons   is   present   in   the   Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be \r\nno meaning to  bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated  in the same transcendental \r\nposition with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal \r\nassistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification \r\nis to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in \r\nthe Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahmäpy eti. One can attain the Supreme \r\nBrahman  by  becoming  Brahman.  This  means  that  one  must  qualitatively \r\nbecome one with Brahman. By attainment  of Brahman, one does not lose his \r\neternal Brahman identity as an individual soul."

This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage \r\nin self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental \r\nto the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. \r\nIf  he  wants,  he  can  continue  to  stay  in  the  Brahman  position  and  then \r\ngradually rise up to Paramätmä realization and then to the realization of  the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic \r\nliterature.  The  four  Kumäras  were  situated  first  in  the  impersonal  Brahman \r\nconception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional \r\nservice. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of \r\nBrahman runs the risk of falling down. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that \r\nalthough a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going \r\nfurther,  with  no  information  of  the  Supreme  Person,  his  intelligence  is  not \r\nperfectly  clear.  Therefore,  in  spite  of  being  raised  to  the  Brahman  platform, \r\nthere  is  the  chance  of  falling  down  if  one  is  not  engaged  in  the  devotional \r\nservice of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said, raso vai saù, rasaà hy \r\neväyaà  labdhvänandé  bhavati:  “When  one  understands  the  Personality  of \r\nGodhead,        the    reservoir     of    pleasure,     Kåñëa,      he    actually     becomes \r\ntranscendentally blissful.” (Taittiréya Upaniñad 2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full \r\nin six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of \r\nthese six opulences. The servant of the  king enjoys on an almost equal level \r\nwith the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal \r\nlife  accompany  devotional  service.  Therefore,  realization  of  Brahman,  or \r\neternity,  or  imperishability,  is  included  in  devotional  service.  This  is  already \r\npossessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service. \r\n    The  living  entity,  although  Brahman  by  nature,  has  the  desire  to  lord  it \r\nover  the  material  world,  and  due  to  this  he  falls  down.  In  his  constitutional \r\nposition,  a  living  entity  is  above  the  three  modes  of  material  nature,  but \r\nassociation  with  material  nature  entangles  him  in  the  different  modes  of \r\nmaterial  nature—goodness,  passion  and  ignorance. Due to the association of \r\nthese  three  modes,  his  desire  to  dominate  the  material  world  is  there.  By \r\nengagement        in   devotional     service    in    full  Kåñëa     consciousness,      he    is \r\nimmediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to"

Therefore  the  process  of  devotional \r\nservice, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering—the prescribed nine \r\nmethods     for   realizing    devotional    service—should        be   practiced    in   the \r\nassociation of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the \r\nspiritual  master,  one’s  material  desire  to  dominate  is  removed,  and  one \r\nbecomes  firmly  situated  in  the  Lord’s  transcendental  loving  service.  This \r\nmethod is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. \r\nDevotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the \r\nservice of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, \r\nsmell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the \r\nLord  had  His  transcendental  pastimes,  read  of  the  different  activities  of  the \r\nLord,    His   reciprocation     of  love   with    His   devotees,    chant    always    the \r\ntranscendental  vibration  Hare  Kåñëa,  Hare  Kåñëa,  Kåñëa  Kåñëa,  Hare  Hare/ \r\nHare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days \r\ncommemorating  the  appearances  and  disappearances  of  the  Lord  and  His \r\ndevotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from \r\nall material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti or \r\nthe  different  varieties  of  the  Brahman  conception  is  equal  to  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead in quality."

The tree \r\nof  this  material  world  has  no  end,  and  for  one  who  is  attached  to  this  tree, \r\nthere  is  no  possibility  of  liberation.  The  Vedic  hymns,  meant  for  elevating \r\noneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree’s roots grow upward because \r\nthey begin from where Brahmä is located, the topmost planet of this universe. \r\nIf one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out \r\nof it. \r\n    This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it \r\nhas been explained that there are many  processes by which to get out of the \r\nmaterial entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that \r\ndevotional  service  to  the  Supreme  Lord  is  the  best  way.  Now,  the  basic \r\nprinciple  of  devotional  service  is  detachment  from  material  activities  and \r\nattachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking \r\nattachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. \r\nThe  root  of  this  material  existence  grows  upward.  This  means  that  it  begins \r\nfrom  the  total  material  substance,  from  the  topmost  planet  of  the  universe. \r\nFrom   there,   the   whole   universe   is   expanded,   with   so   many   branches, \r\nrepresenting the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of \r\nthe  living  entities’  activities,  namely,  religion,  economic  development,  sense \r\ngratification and liberation. \r\n    Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its \r\nbranches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be \r\nfound beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect \r\nupon  the  water  with  their  branches  down  and  roots  up.  In  other  words,  the \r\ntree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual \r\nworld. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as a tree’s \r\nreflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things’ being situated in \r\nthis  reflected  material  light.  One  who  wants  to  get  out  of  this  material \r\nexistence  must  know  this  tree  thoroughly  through  analytical  study.  Then  he \r\ncan cut off his relationship with it. \r\n    This   tree,   being   the   reflection   of   the   real   tree,   is   an   exact   replica. \r\nEverything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to \r\nbe  the  root  of  this  material  tree,  and  from  the  root,  according  to  Säìkhya"

If \r\nBrahman  is  the  center  of  all  manifestations,  then  this  material  world  is  a \r\nmanifestation   of   the   center   by   180   degrees,   and   the   other   180   degrees \r\nconstitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection, \r\nso the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The \r\nprakåti  is  the  external  energy  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  and  the  puruña  is  the \r\nSupreme  Lord  Himself,  and  that  is  explained  in  Bhagavad-gétä.  Since  this \r\nmanifestation  is  material,  it  is  temporary.  A  reflection  is  temporary,  for  it  is \r\nsometimes  seen  and  sometimes  not  seen.  But  the  origin  from  whence  the \r\nreflection is reflected is eternal. The material reflection of the real tree has to \r\nbe cut off. When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he \r\nknows  how  to  cut  off  attachment  to  this  material  world.  If  one  knows  that \r\nprocess, he actually knows the  Vedas. One who is attracted by the ritualistic \r\nformulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He \r\ndoes not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas. The purpose of the  Vedas, as \r\ndisclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected \r\ntree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world."

Sometimes we find that a tract of land \r\nis  barren  for  want  of  sufficient  water,  and  sometimes  a  tract  is  very  green; \r\nsimilarly,   where   particular   modes   of   material   nature   are   proportionately \r\ngreater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested accordingly. \r\n    The   twigs   of   the   tree   are   considered   to   be   the   sense   objects.   By \r\ndevelopment of the different modes of nature we develop different senses, and \r\nby  the  senses  we  enjoy  different  varieties  of  sense  objects.

Because   the \r\nconditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is \r\nvery difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \r\nOne should know by the cultivation of  real knowledge that he is not lord of \r\nmaterial nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is \r\nfree from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For \r\none  who  is  always  expecting  some  honor  in  this  material  world,  it  is  not \r\npossible  to  surrender  to  the  Supreme  Person.  Pride  is  due  to  illusion,  for \r\nalthough one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the \r\nfoolish  notion  that  he  is  the  lord  of  the  world.  He  thus  makes  all  things \r\ncomplicated,  and  he  is  always  in  trouble.  The  whole  world  moves  under  this \r\nimpression.  People  are  considering  the  land,  this  earth,  to  belong  to  human \r\nsociety, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they \r\nare the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society \r\nis the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he \r\nbecomes  free  from  all  the  false  associations  caused  by  familial,  social  and \r\nnational affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. \r\nAfter this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate \r\nknowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And \r\nwhen one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all \r\ndual   conceptions   such   as   happiness   and   distress,   pleasure   and   pain.   He \r\nbecomes  full  in  knowledge;  then  it  is  possible  for  him  to  surrender  to  the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead."

Then there is no \r\nchance  of  his  coming  back  here.  In  his  conditional  life,  the  living  entity \r\nconsiders himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state \r\nhe enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme \r\nLord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge. \r\n    One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer \r\nhimself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of \r\nreality.  For  one  who  is  too  much  attached  to  this  material  world,  it  is  very \r\ndifficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Kåñëa consciousness there is \r\na  chance  of  gradually  becoming  detached.  One  has  to  associate  himself  with \r\ndevotees,  those  who  are  in  Kåñëa  consciousness.  One  should  search  out  a \r\nsociety    dedicated     to   Kåñëa     consciousness      and    learn    how    to   discharge \r\ndevotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material \r\nworld. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world \r\nsimply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the \r\ndevotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that \r\ndevotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get \r\nout  of  this  false  representation  of  the  real  tree.  In  Chapter  Fourteen  the \r\ncontamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only \r\ndevotional service is described as purely transcendental. \r\n    The  words  paramaà  mama  are  very  important  here.  Actually  every  nook \r\nand  corner  is  the  property  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  but  the  spiritual  world  is \r\nparamam, full of six opulences. The Kaöha Upaniñad (2.2.15) also confirms that \r\nin  the  spiritual  world  there  is  no  need  of  sunshine,  moonshine  or  stars  (na \r\ntatra süryo bhäti na candratärakam), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated \r\nby  the  internal  potency  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  That  supreme  abode  can  be \r\nachieved only by surrender and by no other means."

Similarly,   the \r\nseparated  expansions  of  living  entities  have  their  identities.  As  fragmental \r\nparts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental \r\nportions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as \r\nan  individual  soul,  has  his  personal  individuality  and  a  minute  form  of \r\nindependence.  By  misuse  of  that  independence  one  becomes  a  conditioned \r\nsoul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, \r\nhe is qualitatively eternal, as  the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is \r\nfreed  from  this  material  condition,  and  he  is  under  the  engagement  of \r\ntranscendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated \r\nby  the  material  modes  of  nature,  and  he  forgets  the  transcendental  loving \r\nservice of the Lord. As a result, he has  to struggle very hard to maintain his \r\nexistence in the material world. \r\n    The living entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even \r\nthe  greater  controllers  of  the  material  world—Brahmä,  Lord  Çiva  and  even \r\nViñëu—are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not \r\ntemporary manifestations. The word  karñati (“struggling” or “grappling hard”) \r\nis  very  significant.  The  conditioned  soul  is  bound  up,  as  though  shackled  by \r\niron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent \r\nwhich is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode \r\nof goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, \r\nhis activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, \r\nhe travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the \r\nconditioned  soul  is  covered  by  the  material  body,  with  the  mind  and  the \r\nsenses,  and  when  he  is  liberated  this  material  covering  perishes,  but  his \r\nspiritual   body   manifests   itself   in   its   individual   capacity.

This  fragment  is  not \r\nmaterially  conceived.  It  is  not  like  matter,  which  can  be  cut  into  pieces  and \r\njoined  together  again.  That  conception  is  not  applicable  here,  because  the \r\nSanskrit word sanätana (“eternal”) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. \r\nIt is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that in each and every \r\nindividual body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present (dehino \r\n’smin  yathä  dehe).  That  fragmental  portion,  when  liberated  from  the  bodily \r\nentanglement,  revives  its  original  spiritual  body  in  the  spiritual  sky  in  a \r\nspiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, \r\nunderstood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of \r\nthe  Supreme  Lord,  is  qualitatively  one  with  the  Lord,  just  as  the  parts  and \r\nparcels of gold are also gold."

That is discussed in the  Brahma-saàhitä. It is said there that one \r\nplenary  portion  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  Paramätmä,  enters \r\ninto  the  planets,  the  universe,  the  living  entity,  and  even  into  the  atom.  So \r\ndue to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit \r\nsoul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is \r\nout  of  the  body  and  the  body  is  dead,  the  body  sinks.  Of  course  when  it  is \r\ndecomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is \r\ndead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in \r\nspace, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead.  His  energy  is  sustaining  each  planet,  just  like  a \r\nhandful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of \r\nthe  dust’s  falling,  but  if  one  throws  it  in  the  air  it  will  fall  down.  Similarly, \r\nthese planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the \r\nuniversal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving \r\nand nonmoving things stay in their place. It is said in the Vedic hymns that \r\nbecause  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  the  sun  is  shining  and  the \r\nplanets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, \r\nlike dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon’s influence, \r\nthe vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can \r\nneither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably \r\nand  enjoying  food  due  to  the  supply  from  the  Supreme  Lord.  Otherwise, \r\nmankind   could   not   survive.   The   word   rasätmakaù   is   very   significant. \r\nEverything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the \r\ninfluence of the moon."

Therefore he begins his work according to \r\nhis  past  deeds.  Required  knowledge  is  supplied  to  him,  and  remembrance  is \r\ngiven to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only \r\nall-pervading;  He  is  also  localized  in  every  individual  heart.  He  awards  the \r\ndifferent   fruitive   results.   He   is   worshipable   not   only   as   the   impersonal \r\nBrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramätmä, \r\nbut  as  the  form  of  the  incarnation  of  the  Vedas  as  well.  The  Vedas  give  the \r\nright direction to people so that they can properly mold their lives and come \r\nback to Godhead, back to home. The  Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and Kåñëa in His incarnation as Vyäsadeva is \r\nthe compiler of the Vedänta-sütra. The commentation on the Vedänta-sütra by \r\nVyäsadeva       in  the    Çrémad-Bhägavatam          gives   the    real   understanding       of \r\nVedänta-sütra.  The  Supreme  Lord  is  so  full  that  for  the  deliverance  of  the \r\nconditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his \r\nactivity, and the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead,  Çré  Kåñëa,  the  teacher  of  the  Bhagavad-gétä.

So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in \r\nthis world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in \r\nthe heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand the Vedas from Him. \r\nIf one is serious about understanding the  Vedic knowledge, then Kåñëa gives \r\nthe  required  intelligence.  Why  does  He  present  the  Vedic  knowledge  for \r\nunderstanding?  Because  a  living  entity  individually  needs  to  understand \r\nKåñëa. Vedic literature confirms this: yo ’sau sarvair vedair géyate.

He  says  that  the  living  entities,  who  are  innumerable,  can  be \r\ndivided into two classes—the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are \r\neternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \r\nWhen they are in contact with the material world they are called jéva-bhüta, \r\nand the Sanskrit words given here, kñaraù sarväëi bhütäni, mean that they are \r\nfallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \r\nhowever,  are  called  infallible.  Oneness  does  not  mean  that  they  have  no \r\nindividuality,  but  that  there  is  no  disunity.  They  are  all  agreeable  to  the \r\npurpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world there is no such thing \r\nas  creation,  but  since  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  as  stated  in  the \r\nVedänta-sütra, is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained. \r\n    According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \r\nKåñëa, there are two classes of living entities. The Vedas give evidence of this, \r\nso  there  is  no  doubt  about  it.  The  living  entities  who  are  struggling  in  this \r\nworld  with  the  mind  and  five  senses  have  their  material  bodies,  which  are \r\nchanging.  As  long  as  a  living  entity  is  conditioned,  his  body  changes  due  to \r\ncontact  with  matter;  matter  is  changing,  so  the  living  entity  appears  to  be \r\nchanging. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore \r\nthere  is  no  change.  In  the  material  world  the  living  entity  undergoes  six \r\nchanges—birth,         growth,     duration,      reproduction,      then     dwindling      and \r\nvanishing.  These  are  the  changes  of  the  material  body.  But  in  the  spiritual \r\nworld the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is \r\nno death. There all exists in oneness. Kñaraù sarväëi bhütäni: any living entity \r\nwho has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, \r\nBrahmä,  down  to  a  small  ant,  is  changing  its  body;  therefore  they  are  all \r\nfallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness."

That  Supreme  is  called  the \r\nSupreme Personality.” This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting \r\nand diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That \r\nSupreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramätmä. By incarnating \r\nHimself as the son of Satyavaté and Paräçara, He explains the Vedic knowledge \r\nas Vyäsadeva."

Now in this \r\nverse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who \r\nknows  Lord  Kåñëa  to  be  the  Supreme  Person  is  actually  the  knower  of \r\neverything.  The  imperfect  knower  goes  on  simply  speculating  about  the \r\nAbsolute  Truth,  but  the  perfect  knower,  without  wasting  his  valuable  time, \r\nengages directly in Kåñëa consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme \r\nLord.

And    still  there   are   so   many     stubborn     commentators       on \r\nBhagavad-gétä  who  consider  the  Supreme  Absolute  Truth  and  the  living \r\nentities to be one and the same. \r\n    Vedic  knowledge  is  called  çruti,  learning  by  aural  reception.  One  should \r\nactually  receive  the  Vedic  message  from  authorities  like  Kåñëa  and  His \r\nrepresentatives.  Here  Kåñëa  distinguishes  everything  very  nicely,  and  one \r\nshould hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one \r\nmust  be  able  to  understand  from  the  authorities.  It  is  not  that  one  should \r\nsimply     speculate     academically.     One      should    submissively      hear    from \r\nBhagavad-gétä that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead. Anyone who is  able to understand this, according to \r\nthe  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  Çré  Kåñëa,  knows  the  purpose  of  the \r\nVedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas. \r\n    The  word  bhajati  is  very  significant.

And  one  should  understand  this  as  it  is  given  by  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead.  Thus  one  will  become  intelligent  and  perfect  in \r\ntranscendental  knowledge.  In  other  words,  by  understanding  this  philosophy \r\nof  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  and  engaging  in  His  transcendental \r\nservice, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of \r\nmaterial  nature.  Devotional  service  is  a  process  of  spiritual  understanding. \r\nWherever   devotional   service   exists,   the   material   contamination   cannot \r\ncoexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the \r\nsame  because  they  are  spiritual;  devotional  service  takes  place  within  the \r\ninternal  energy  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  The  Lord  is  said  to  be  the  sun,  and \r\nignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of \r\ndarkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper \r\nguidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance. \r\n    Everyone must take to this consciousness of Kåñëa and engage in devotional \r\nservice to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of \r\nunderstanding Kåñëa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he \r\nmay be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent. \r\n    The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant.  Anagha, “O \r\nsinless one,” means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very \r\ndifficult to understand Kåñëa. One has to become free from all contamination, \r\nall sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure \r\nand  potent  that  once  one  is  engaged  in  devotional  service  he  automatically \r\ncomes to the stage of sinlessness. \r\n    While  one  is  performing  devotional  service  in  the  association  of  pure \r\ndevotees in full Kåñëa consciousness, there are certain things which require to \r\nbe  vanquished  altogether.  The  most  important  thing  one  has  to  surmount  is \r\nweakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over \r\nmaterial  nature.  Thus  one  gives  up  the  transcendental  loving  service  of  the \r\nSupreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the \r\npropensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and"

The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the \r\nactivities  of  the  living  entities,  some  auspicious,  some  inauspicious.  In  the \r\nNinth  Chapter,  also,  the  devas,  or  godly,  and  the  asuras,  the  ungodly,  or \r\ndemons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode \r\nof  goodness  are  considered  auspicious  for  progress  on  the  path  of  liberation, \r\nand such activities are known as daivé prakåti, transcendental by nature. Those \r\nwho  are  situated  in  the  transcendental  nature  make  progress  on  the  path  of \r\nliberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on \r\nthe  other  hand,  there  is  no  possibility of liberation. Either they will have to \r\nremain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the \r\nspecies of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord \r\nexplains  both  the  transcendental  nature  and  its  attendant  qualities  and  the \r\ndemoniac  nature  and  its  qualities.  He  also  explains  the  advantages  and \r\ndisadvantages of these qualities. \r\n    The word  abhijätasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities \r\nor godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere \r\nis  known  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  as  Garbhädhäna-saàskära.

They are to keep the \r\nsociety in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are \r\nexplained  as  transcendental  qualities  meant  for  making  a  person  progress  in \r\nspiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world. \r\n    In the varëäçrama institution the sannyäsé, or the person in the renounced \r\norder of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social \r\nstatuses and orders. A brähmaëa is considered to be the spiritual master of the \r\nthree  other  sections  of  a  society,  namely,  the  kñatriyas,  the  vaiçyas  and  the \r\nçüdras, but a  sannyäsé, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be \r\nthe   spiritual    master     of  the    brähmaëas      also.   For   a   sannyäsé,    the    first \r\nqualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyäsé has to be alone without \r\nany support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of \r\nthe   Supreme   Personality   of   Godhead.  If  one  thinks,  “After  I  leave  my \r\nconnections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced  order \r\nof life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead  in  His  localized  aspect  as  Paramätmä  is  always  within,  that  He  is \r\nseeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus \r\nhave  firm  conviction  that  Kåñëa  as  Paramätmä  will  take  care  of  a  soul \r\nsurrendered to Him. “I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live \r\nin the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will \r\ngive me all protection.” That conviction is called  abhayam, fearlessness. This \r\nstate of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. \r\n    Then   he   has   to   purify   his   existence.   There   are   so   many   rules   and \r\nregulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, \r\na  sannyäsé  is  strictly  forbidden  to  have  any  intimate  relationship  with  a \r\nwoman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord \r\nCaitanya  was  an  ideal  sannyäsé,  and  when  He  was  at  Puré  His  feminine \r\ndevotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised \r\nto bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a"

One  has  to  follow  the  rules  and  regulations  of  a \r\nparticular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyäsé, intimate \r\nrelations  with  women  and  possession  of  wealth  for  sense  gratification  are \r\nstrictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can \r\nlearn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is \r\nconsidered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most \r\nfallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the \r\nsannyäsa order of life in connection with association with woman. One of His \r\npersonal     associates,    namely      Choöa     Haridäsa,     was    associated     with    Lord \r\nCaitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow \r\nor  other  this  Choöa  Haridäsa  looked  lustily  on  a  young  woman,  and  Lord \r\nCaitanya  was  so  strict  that  He  at  once  rejected  him  from  the  society  of  His \r\npersonal  associates.  Lord  Caitanya  said,  “For  a  sannyäsé  or  anyone  who  is \r\naspiring  to  get  out  of  the  clutches  of  material  nature  and  trying  to  elevate \r\nhimself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him, \r\nlooking  toward  material  possessions  and  women  for  sense  gratification—not \r\neven enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity—is \r\nso  condemned  that  he  had  better  commit  suicide  before  experiencing  such \r\nillicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification. \r\n    The next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of \r\nknowledge.       Sannyäsé     life   is  meant     for    distributing     knowledge       to   the \r\nhouseholders   and   others   who   have   forgotten   their   real   life   of   spiritual \r\nadvancement.  A  sannyäsé  is  supposed  to  beg  from  door  to  door  for  his \r\nlivelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of \r\nthe  qualifications  of  a  transcendentally  situated  person,  and  out  of  sheer \r\nhumility  the  sannyäsé  goes  from  door  to  door,  not  exactly  for  the  purpose of \r\nbegging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness. \r\nThis is the duty of a sannyäsé. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his \r\nspiritual   master,   he   should   preach   Kåñëa   consciousness   with   logic   and \r\nunderstanding,  and  if  one  is  not  so  advanced  he  should  not  accept  the \r\nrenounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of \r\nlife  without  sufficient  knowledge,  he  should  engage  himself  fully  in  hearing"

A sannyäsé, or one in \r\nthe renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhi \r\n(purity) and jïäna-yoga (knowledge). \r\n    The  next  item  is  charity.  Charity  is  meant  for  the  householders.  The \r\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood  by an honorable means and spend fifty \r\npercent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world. \r\nThus  a  householder  should  give  in  charity  to  institutional  societies  that  are \r\nengaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are \r\ndifferent kinds of charity, as will be explained later on—charity in the modes \r\nof  goodness,  passion  and  ignorance.  Charity  in  the  mode  of  goodness  is \r\nrecommended  by  the  scriptures,  but  charity  in  the  modes  of  passion  and \r\nignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity \r\nshould be given only to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world. That \r\nis charity in the mode of goodness. \r\n    Then  as  far  as  dama  (self-control)  is  concerned,  it  is  not  only  meant  for \r\nother  orders  of  religious  society,  but  is especially meant for the householder. \r\nAlthough  he  has  a  wife,  a  householder  should  not  use  his  senses  for  sex  life \r\nunnecessarily.  There  are  restrictions  for  the  householders  even  in  sex  life, \r\nwhich should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not \r\nrequire  children,  he  should  not  enjoy  sex  life  with  his  wife.  Modern  society \r\nenjoys  sex  life  with  contraceptive  methods  or  more  abominable  methods  to \r\navoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality, \r\nbut is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress \r\nin  spiritual  life,  he  must  control  his  sex  life  and  should  not  beget  a  child \r\nwithout the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If he is able to beget children who will \r\nbe in Kåñëa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without \r\nthis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure. \r\n    Sacrifice  is  another  item  to  be  performed  by  the  householders,  because \r\nsacrifices  require  a  large  amount  of  money.  Those  in  other  orders  of  life, \r\nnamely  brahmacarya, vänaprastha and  sannyäsa, have no money; they live by \r\nbegging.  So  performance  of  different  types  of  sacrifice  is  meant  for  the \r\nhouseholders.  They  should  perform  agni-hotra  sacrifices  as  enjoined  in  the \r\nVedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive,"

The best sacrifice \r\nrecommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa. This saìkértana-yajïa, the \r\nchanting  of  Hare  Kåñëa,  Hare  Kåñëa,  Kåñëa  Kåñëa,  Hare  Hare/  Hare  Räma, \r\nHare  Räma,  Räma  Räma,  Hare  Hare,  is  the  best  and  most  inexpensive \r\nsacrifice;  everyone  can  adopt  it  and  derive  benefit.  So  these  three  items, \r\nnamely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the \r\nhouseholder. \r\n    Then  svädhyäya,  Vedic  study,  is  meant  for  brahmacarya,  or  student  life. \r\nBrahmacärés should have no connection with women; they should live a life of \r\ncelibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of \r\nspiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäya. \r\n    Tapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not \r\nremain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that \r\nthere   are   four   divisions   of   life—brahmacarya,   gåhastha,   vänaprastha   and \r\nsannyäsa. So after gåhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for \r\na hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five \r\nin   householder   life,   twenty-five   in   retired   life   and   twenty-five   in   the \r\nrenounced  order  of  life.  These  are  the  regulations  of  the  Vedic  religious \r\ndiscipline. A man retired from household  life must practice austerities of the \r\nbody, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire varëäçrama-dharma society \r\nis  meant  for  tapasya.  Without  tapasya,  or  austerity,  no  human  being  can  get \r\nliberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go \r\non  speculating  and  everything  will  be  nice,  is  recommended  neither  in  the \r\nVedic  literature  nor  in  Bhagavad-gétä.  Such  theories  are  manufactured  by \r\nshow-bottle spiritualists  who are trying to gather more followers. If there are \r\nrestrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore \r\nthose  who  want  followers  in  the  name  of  religion,  just  to  have  a  show  only, \r\ndon’t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is \r\nnot approved by the Vedas. \r\n    As far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should \r\na particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the \r\nbrahmacäré äçrama, gåhastha  äçrama, vänaprastha äçrama or  sannyäsa äçrama. \r\nOne should be very simple and straightforward."

One \r\nshould  not  think  that  since  the  spirit  spark  is  never  killed  even  after  the \r\nkilling of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. \r\nPeople are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply \r\nof  grains,  fruits  and  milk.  There  is  no  necessity  for  animal  killing.  This \r\ninjunction  is  for  everyone.

At  any  rate,  when  there  is  an \r\nample     food    supply    for    humanity,      persons     who     are   desiring    to   make \r\nadvancement  in  spiritual  realization  should  not  commit  violence  to  animals. \r\nReal ahiàsä means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also \r\nmaking progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category \r\nof animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is \r\nchecked.  If  an  animal  is  staying  in  a  particular  body  for  so  many  days  or  so \r\nmany years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form \r\nof  life  to  complete  the  remaining  days  in  order  to  be  promoted  to  another \r\nspecies of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s \r\npalate. This is called ahiàsä. \r\n    Satyam.

In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the \r\nmeaning  or  the  purpose  should  be  learned from a bona fide spiritual master. \r\nThat is the process for understanding the  Vedas.  Çruti means that one should \r\nhear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his \r\npersonal  interest.  There  are  so  many  commentaries  on  Bhagavad-gétä  that \r\nmisinterpret   the   original   text.   The   real   import   of   the   word   should   be \r\npresented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. \r\n    Akrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be \r\ntolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger \r\nis a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally \r\nsituated should check himself  from anger.  Apaiçunam means that one should \r\nnot  find  fault  with  others  or  correct  them  unnecessarily.  Of  course  to  call  a \r\nthief  a  thief  is  not  faultfinding,  but  to  call  an  honest  person  a  thief  is  very \r\nmuch offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hré means \r\nthat  one  should  be  very  modest  and  must  not  perform  some  act  which  is"

Acäpalam, determination, means that  one should not be agitated \r\nor frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one \r\nshould  not  be  sorry  for  that;  he  should  make  progress  with  patience  and \r\ndetermination. \r\n    The  word  tejas  used  here  is  meant  for  the  kñatriyas.  The  kñatriyas  should \r\nalways be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should \r\nnot pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it. \r\nBut a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions \r\nshow forgiveness.

It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in \r\nthe black market. Näti-mänitä, not expecting honor, applies to the çüdras, the \r\nworker class, which are  considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the \r\nlowest  of  the  four  classes.  They  should  not  be  puffed  up  with  unnecessary \r\nprestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the \r\nçüdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order. \r\n    All these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. \r\nThey  should  be  cultivated  according  to  the  different  statuses  of  social  and \r\noccupational  order.  The  purport  is  that  even  though  material  conditions  are \r\nmiserable,  if  these  qualities  are  developed  by  practice,  by  all  classes  of  men, \r\nthen gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental \r\nrealization."

Those  who  are  born  with  divine \r\nqualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in \r\nscriptures  and  by  the  authorities.  One  should  perform  duties  in  the  light  of \r\nauthoritative  scripture.  This  mentality  is  called  divine.  One  who  does  not \r\nfollow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who \r\nacts  according  to  his  whims  is  called  demoniac  or  asuric.  There  is  no  other \r\ncriterion   but   obedience   to   the   regulative   principles   of   scriptures.   It   is \r\nmentioned  in  Vedic  literature  that  both  the  demigods  and  the  demons  are \r\nborn  of  the  Prajäpati;  the  only  difference  is  that  one  class  obeys  the  Vedic \r\ninjunctions and the other does not."

The demons neither like nor follow all \r\nthese rules for external and internal cleanliness. \r\n    As  for  behavior,  there  are  many  rules  and  regulations  guiding  human \r\nbehavior, such as the Manu-saàhitä, which is the law of the human race. Even \r\nup   to   today,   those   who   are   Hindu   follow   the   Manu-saàhitä.   Laws   of \r\ninheritance  and  other  legalities  are  derived  from  this  book.  Now,  in  the \r\nManu-saàhitä it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. \r\nThat  does  not  mean  that  women  are  to  be  kept  as  slaves,  but  they  are  like \r\nchildren.  Children  are  not  given  freedom, but that does not mean that they \r\nare kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they \r\nthink that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has \r\nnot improved the social condition of  the world. Actually, a woman should be \r\ngiven protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the \r\nfather in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup \r\nsons   in   her   old   age.   This   is   proper   social   behavior   according   to   the \r\nManu-saàhitä.  But  modern  education  has  artificially  devised  a  puffed-up \r\nconcept   of   womanly   life,   and   therefore   marriage   is   practically   now   an \r\nimagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good \r\nnow. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for \r\nsociety, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the \r\nrules  and  regulations  laid  down  by  the  sages,  the  social  condition  of  the \r\ndemoniac people is very miserable."

A  demoniac \r\nperson believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. \r\nAccording  to  the  law  of  karma,  a  man  takes  his  birth  in  a  high  family,  or \r\nbecomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in \r\nthe past. The demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to \r\nthe  strength  of  one’s  personal  ability.  They  do  not  sense  any  arrangement \r\nbehind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes \r\ninto  competition  with  such  a  demoniac  man  is  his  enemy.  There  are  many \r\ndemoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more \r\nand   more   deep—between   persons,   then   between   families,   then   between \r\nsocieties, and at last between nations.  Therefore there is constant strife, war \r\nand enmity all over the world. \r\n    Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. \r\nGenerally,  a  demoniac  person  thinks  of  himself  as  the  Supreme  God,  and  a \r\ndemoniac  preacher  tells  his  followers:  “Why  are  you  seeking  God  elsewhere? \r\nYou are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in \r\nGod. Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings. \r\n    Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or \r\neven more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more \r\ninfluential  than  he.  As  far  as  promotion  to  the  higher  planetary  system  is \r\nconcerned,  he  does  not  believe  in  performing  yajïas,  or  sacrifices.  Demons \r\nthink that they will manufacture their own process of yajïa and prepare some \r\nmachine  by  which  they  will  be  able  to  reach  any  higher  planet.  The  best \r\nexample  of  such  a  demoniac  man  was  Rävaëa.  He  offered  a  program  to  the \r\npeople by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the \r\nheavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the \r\nVedas. Similarly, in the present age such  demoniac men are striving to reach"

Everyone is expected to \r\nfollow  these  rules  and  regulations.  If  one  does  not  follow  them  and  acts \r\nwhimsically  according  to  his  lust,  greed  and  desire,  then  he  never  will  be \r\nperfect  in  his  life.  In  other  words,  a  man  may  theoretically  know  all  these \r\nthings, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as \r\nthe lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to \r\nbe sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest \r\nplatform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if \r\nhe follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does \r\nnot  come  to  the  stage  of  understanding  the  Supreme  Lord,  then  all  his \r\nknowledge becomes spoiled.

These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one \r\nfrom putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations \r\nas  described  in  the  çästra—being  above  these  defects—are  accepted  without \r\nalteration by all great saints, äcäryas and great souls. \r\n    In   India   there   are   many   parties   of   spiritual   understanding,   generally \r\nclassified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, \r\nlead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the \r\nprinciples  of  the  scriptures,  one  cannot  elevate  himself  to  the  perfectional \r\nstage.  One  who  actually,  therefore,  understands  the  purport  of  the  çästras  is \r\nconsidered fortunate. \r\n    In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead  is  the  cause  of  all  falldowns.

Therefore,  mäyä,  the  material  energy  of  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead,  is  always  giving  us  trouble  in  the  shape  of  the \r\nthreefold  miseries.  This  material  energy  is  constituted  of  the  three  modes  of \r\nmaterial  nature.  One  has  to  raise  himself  at  least  to  the  mode  of  goodness \r\nbefore the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without \r\nraising  oneself  to  the  standard  of  the  mode  of  goodness,  one  remains  in \r\nignorance  and  passion,  which  are  the  cause  of  demoniac  life.  Those  in  the \r\nmodes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and \r\nderide the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They \r\ndisobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the \r\nregulations  of  the  scriptures.  In  spite  of  hearing  the  glories  of  devotional \r\nservice,  they  are  not  attracted.  Thus  they  manufacture  their  own  way  of \r\nelevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the \r\ndemoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and \r\nbona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to  the \r\nhigher stage, then one’s life becomes successful."

But this nature can be \r\nchanged if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his \r\nrules   and   the   scriptures.   Gradually,   one   can   change   his   position   from \r\nignorance  to  goodness,  or  from  passion  to  goodness.  The  conclusion  is  that \r\nblind  faith  in  a  particular  mode  of  nature  cannot  help  a  person  become \r\nelevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with \r\nintelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can \r\nchange his position to a higher mode of nature."

The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. \r\nAlthough  one  may  be  conducted  by  some impression, or some conception of \r\nlife, originally he is  nirguëa, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become \r\ncleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain \r\nhis  relationship  with  the  Supreme  Lord.  That  is  the  only  path  back  without \r\nfear: Kåñëa consciousness. If one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, then that \r\npath is guaranteed for his elevation to  the perfectional stage. If one does not \r\ntake to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the \r\ninfluence of the modes of nature. \r\n    The word  çraddhä, or “faith,” is very significant in this verse.  Çraddhä, or \r\nfaith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One’s faith may be in a \r\ndemigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One’s strong faith is \r\nsupposed  to  be  productive  of  works  of  material  goodness.  But  in  material \r\nconditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are \r\nnot  in  pure  goodness.  Pure  goodness  is  transcendental;  in  purified  goodness \r\none can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \r\nAs  long  as  one’s  faith  is  not  completely  in  purified  goodness,  the  faith  is \r\nsubject  to  contamination  by  any  of  the  modes  of  material  nature.  The \r\ncontaminated   modes   of   material   nature   expand   to   the   heart.   Therefore \r\naccording  to  the  position  of  the  heart  in  contact  with  a  particular  mode  of \r\nmaterial nature, one’s faith is established. It should be understood that if one’s \r\nheart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his \r\nheart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if \r\nhis   heart   is   in   the   mode   of   darkness,   illusion,   his   faith   is   also   thus \r\ncontaminated.  Thus  we  find  different  types of faith in this world, and there \r\nare  different  types  of  religions  due  to  different  types  of  faith.  The  real \r\nprinciple  of  religious  faith  is  situated  in  the  mode  of  pure  goodness,  but \r\nbecause the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus \r\naccording to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship."

They  think  that  anyone  can  be  worshiped  as  God \r\nand that the same results will be obtained. \r\n    Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion \r\nworship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in \r\ndarkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some \r\ndead  man.  Sexual  service  is  also  considered  to  be  in  the  mode  of  darkness. \r\nSimilarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have \r\nseen that in India the lower-class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they \r\nhave knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer \r\nsacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God \r\nworship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In \r\nthe     Çrémad-Bhägavatam           (4.3.23)      it    is    said,    sattvaà      viçuddhaà \r\nvasudeva-çabditam:  “When  a  man  is  situated  in  pure  goodness,  he  worships \r\nVäsudeva.”  The  purport  is  that  those  who  are  completely  purified  of  the \r\nmaterial modes of nature and who are  transcendentally situated can worship \r\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. \r\n    The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and \r\nthey worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Viñëu form \r\nin  the  material  world,  which  is  known  as  philosophized  Viñëu.  Viñëu  is  the \r\nexpansion  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  but  the  impersonalists, \r\nbecause they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \r\nimagine that the Viñëu form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; \r\nsimilarly,  they  imagine  that  Lord  Brahmä  is  the  impersonal  form  in  the \r\nmaterial mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that \r\nare  worshipable,  but  because  they  think  that  the  actual  truth  is  impersonal \r\nBrahman,  they  dispose  of  all  worshipable  objects  at  the  ultimate  end.  In \r\nconclusion,  the  different  qualities  of  the  material  modes  of  nature  can  be \r\npurified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature."

For instance, fasting for some \r\nulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in \r\nthe   scriptural   directions.   The   scriptures   recommend   fasting   for   spiritual \r\nadvancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to \r\nsuch austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gétä, certainly demoniac. Their acts \r\nare against the scriptural injunctions and are not beneficial for the people in \r\ngeneral.  Actually,  they  act  out  of  pride,  false  ego,  lust  and  attachment  for \r\nmaterial enjoyment. By such activities, not only is the combination of material \r\nelements  of  which  the  body  is  constructed  disturbed,  but  also  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead  Himself  living  within  the  body.  Such  unauthorized \r\nfasting  or  austerities  for  some  political  end  are  certainly  very  disturbing  to \r\nothers.  They  are  not  mentioned  in  the  Vedic  literature.  A  demoniac  person \r\nmay  think  that  he  can  force  his  enemy  or  other  parties  to  comply  with  his \r\ndesire by this method, but sometimes one  dies by such fasting. These acts are \r\nnot approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those \r\nwho  engage  in  them  are  demons.  Such  demonstrations  are  insults  to  the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to \r\nthe  Vedic  scriptural  injunctions.  The  word  acetasaù  is  significant  in  this \r\nconnection.  Persons  of  normal  mental  condition  must  obey  the  scriptural \r\ninjunctions.  Those  who  are  not  in  such  a  position  neglect  and  disobey  the \r\nscriptures  and  manufacture  their  own  way  of  austerities  and  penances.  One \r\nshould always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described \r\nin the  previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the wombs of \r\ndemoniac  persons.  Consequently  they  will  live  by  demoniac  principles  life \r\nafter life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead.  If,  however,  such  persons  are  fortunate  enough  to  be  guided  by  a \r\nspiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get \r\nout of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal."

Some other foods, such as baked corn \r\nand  molasses,  while  not  very  palatable  in  themselves,  can  be  made  pleasant \r\nwhen mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. \r\nAll these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable \r\nthings like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have \r\nno connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in \r\nthe form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese \r\nand similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the \r\nkilling  of  innocent  creatures.  It  is  only  through  brute  mentality  that  this \r\nkilling  goes  on.  The  civilized  method  of  obtaining  needed  fat  is  by  milk. \r\nSlaughter  is  the  way  of  subhumans.

By such discussions, one may derive \r\nthe  highest  benefit  and  elevate  human  society.  There  is  a  limitless  stock  of \r\nVedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech."

The best \r\ntraining for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one’s nature \r\nis to become Kåñëa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by \r\ntaking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think \r\nof sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age \r\nwe  unnecessarily  engage  the  mind  in  so  many  different  ways  for  sense \r\ngratification,  and  so  there  is  no  possibility  of  the  mind’s  becoming  satisfied. \r\nThe best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is  full of \r\nsatisfying  stories,  as  in  the  Puräëas  and  the  Mahäbhärata.  One  can  take \r\nadvantage  of  this  knowledge  and  thus  become  purified.  The  mind  should  be \r\ndevoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means \r\nthat   one    is  always    thinking     of   self-realization.   The     person    in   Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness  observes  perfect  silence  in  this  sense.  Control  of  the  mind \r\nmeans     detaching      the    mind     from    sense    enjoyment.       One     should    be \r\nstraightforward  in  his  dealings  and  thereby  purify  his  existence.  All  these \r\nqualities together constitute austerity in mental activities."

    "text": "It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided \r\ninto  three  categories:  the  modes  of  goodness,  passion  and  ignorance.  But \r\nwhether  first  class,  second  class  or  third  class,  they  are  all  conditioned, \r\ncontaminated  by  the  material  modes  of  nature.  When  they  are  aimed  at  the \r\nSupreme—oà tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they \r\nbecome  means  for  spiritual  elevation.  In  the  scriptural  injunctions  such  an \r\nobjective is indicated. These three words,  oà tat sat, particularly indicate the \r\nAbsolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the \r\nword oà is always found. \r\n    One  who  acts  without  following  the  regulations  of  the  scriptures  will  not \r\nattain  the  Absolute  Truth.  He  will  get  some  temporary  result,  but  not  the \r\nultimate  end  of  life.  The  conclusion  is  that  the  performance  of  charity, \r\nsacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the \r\nmode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three \r\nwords oà tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme \r\nLord,  e.g.,  oà  tad  viñëoù.  Whenever  a  Vedic  hymn  or  the  holy  name  of  the \r\nSupreme  Lord  is  uttered,  oà  is  added.  This  is  the  indication  of  Vedic \r\nliterature.  These  three  words  are  taken  from  Vedic  hymns.  Oà  ity  etad \r\nbrahmaëo nediñöhaà näma (Åg Veda) indicates the first goal. Then tat tvam asi \r\n(Chändogya  Upaniñad  6.8.7)  indicates  the  second  goal.  And  sad  eva  saumya \r\n(Chändogya Upaniñad  6.2.1)  indicates  the  third  goal.  Combined  they  become \r\noà tat sat. Formerly when Brahmä, the first created living entity, performed \r\nsacrifices,  he  indicated  by  these  three  words  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic"

Bhagavad-gétä  recommends, \r\ntherefore,  that  any  work  done  should  be  done  for  oà  tat  sat,  or  for  the \r\nSupreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  When  one  performs  penance,  charity  and \r\nsacrifice  with  these  three  words,  he  is  acting  in  Kåñëa  consciousness.  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness  is  a  scientific  execution  of  transcendental  activities  which \r\nenables  one  to  return  home,  back  to  Godhead.

In every chapter of  Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa stresses that devotional \r\nservice unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. \r\nThis  same  point  is  summarized  in  the  Eighteenth  Chapter  as  the  most \r\nconfidential  path  of  knowledge.  In  the  first  six  chapters,  stress  was  given  to \r\ndevotional service: yoginäm api sarveñäà.  .. “Of all  yogés or transcendentalists, \r\none who always thinks of Me within himself is best.” In the next six chapters, \r\npure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third \r\nsix  chapters,  knowledge,  renunciation,  the  activities  of  material  nature  and \r\ntranscendental       nature,    and    devotional     service    were    described.    It   was \r\nconcluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme \r\nLord, represented by the words oà tat sat, which indicate Viñëu, the Supreme \r\nPerson. The third part of Bhagavad-gétä has shown that devotional service, and \r\nnothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing \r\npast  äcäryas and the  Brahma-sütra, the  Vedänta-sütra. Certain impersonalists \r\nconsider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of  Vedänta-sütra, \r\nbut actually the  Vedänta-sütra is meant for understanding devotional service, \r\nfor  the  Lord  Himself  is  the  composer  of  the  Vedänta-sütra  and  He  is  its \r\nknower. That is described in the  Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every \r\nVeda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä. \r\n    As  in  the  Second  Chapter  a  synopsis  of  the  whole  subject  matter  was \r\ndescribed,  in  the  Eighteenth  Chapter  also  the  summary  of  all  instruction  is"

Arjuna \r\nwants  to  clarify  the  two  distinct  subject  matters  of  Bhagavad-gétä,  namely \r\nrenunciation  (tyäga)  and  the  renounced  order  of  life  (sannyäsa).  Thus  he  is \r\nasking the meaning of these two words. \r\n    Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord—Håñékeça and \r\nKeçé-niñüdana—are significant.

For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, \r\nyet  some  maintain  that  animal  killing  is  completely  abominable.  Although \r\nanimal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal \r\nis not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. \r\nSometimes  the  animal  is  given  a  new  animal  life  after  being  killed  in  the \r\nsacrifice,  and  sometimes  the  animal  is  promoted  immediately  to  the  human \r\nform of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that \r\nanimal  killing  should  always  be  avoided,  and  others  say  that  for  a  specific \r\nsacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now \r\nbeing clarified by the Lord Himself."

The  Lord  says  here  that  any  sacrifice  which  is  meant  for  human \r\nwelfare  should  never  be  given  up.  Viväha-yajïa,  the  marriage  ceremony,  is \r\nmeant to regulate the human mind so that it may become peaceful for spiritual \r\nadvancement. For most men, this  viväha-yajïa should be encouraged even by \r\npersons in the renounced order of life.  Sannyäsés should never associate with \r\nwomen,  but that does not mean that one who  is in the lower stages of life, a \r\nyoung man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed \r\nsacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower \r\nstages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of \r\nthe  heart.  If  charity  is  given  to  suitable  persons,  as  described  previously,  it \r\nleads one to advanced spiritual life."

    "text": "One’s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-gétä. As already discussed \r\nin  previous  verses,  the  duties  of  a  brähmaëa,  kñatriya,  vaiçya  and  çüdra  are \r\nprescribed  according  to  their  particular  modes  of  nature.  One  should  not \r\nimitate another’s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work \r\ndone by çüdras should not artificially claim to be a brähmaëa, although he may \r\nhave been born into a brähmaëa family. In this way one should work according \r\nto his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the \r\nSupreme Lord. The occupational duty of a  brähmaëa is certainly in the mode \r\nof goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should \r\nnot    imitate    the   occupational      duty    of  a   brähmaëa.   For   a      kñatriya,   or \r\nadministrator,  there  are  so  many  abominable  things;  a  kñatriya  has  to  be \r\nviolent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a kñatriya has to tell lies for the sake \r\nof  diplomacy.  Such  violence  and  duplicity  accompany  political  affairs,  but  a \r\nkñatriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the \r\nduties of a brähmaëa. \r\n    One  should  act  to  satisfy  the  Supreme  Lord.  For  example,  Arjuna  was  a \r\nkñatriya.  He  was  hesitating  to  fight  the  other  party.  But  if  such  fighting  is \r\nperformed for the sake of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there \r\nneed  be  no  fear  of  degradation.  In  the  business  field  also,  sometimes  a \r\nmerchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there \r\ncan be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, “Oh, my dear customer, for you I \r\nam making no profit,” but one should know that without profit the merchant \r\ncannot  exist.  Therefore  it  should  be  taken  as  a  simple  lie  if  a  merchant  says \r\nthat he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because \r\nhe is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he \r\nshould give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brähmaëa. That is"

Whether  one  is  a  kñatriya,  a  vaiçya,  or  a  çüdra  doesn’t \r\nmatter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even \r\nbrähmaëas,  who  perform  different  types  of  sacrifice,  sometimes  must  kill \r\nanimals    because    sometimes      animals    are   sacrificed   in   such   ceremonies. \r\nSimilarly, if a kñatriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is \r\nno  sin  incurred.  In  the  Third  Chapter  these  matters  have  been  clearly  and \r\nelaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yajïa, or for \r\nViñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense \r\ngratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be \r\nengaged  according  to  the  particular  mode  of  nature  he  has  acquired,  and  he \r\nshould decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord."

Even if one is a brähmaëa, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal \r\nkilling is necessary. Similarly, a kñatriya, however pious he may be, has to fight \r\nenemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, \r\nmust sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to \r\ndo business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid \r\nthem. Similarly, even though a man is a çüdra serving a bad master, he has to \r\ncarry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite \r\nthese flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are \r\nborn out of his own nature. \r\n    A  very  nice  example  is  given  herein.  Although  fire  is  pure,  still  there  is \r\nsmoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke \r\nin the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers \r\nto give up the work of a kñatriya and take up the occupation of a brähmaëa, he \r\nis not assured that in the occupation of a  brähmaëa there are no unpleasant \r\nduties.  One  may  then  conclude  that  in  the  material  world  no  one  can  be \r\ncompletely  free  from  the  contamination  of  material  nature.  This  example  of \r\nfire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one \r\ntakes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts \r\nof  the  body,  but  still  one  must  make  use  of  the  fire  despite  disturbing \r\nconditions.  Similarly,  one  should  not  give  up  his  natural  occupation  because \r\nthere are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve \r\nthe Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the \r\nperfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the \r\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation \r\nare  purified.  When  the  results  of  work  are  purified,  when  connected  with \r\ndevotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is \r\nself-realization."

But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has \r\nto go still further, to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means \r\nthat  one  who  is  engaged  in  pure  devotional  service  to  the  Supreme  Lord  is \r\nalready   in   a   state   of   liberation,   called   brahma-bhüta,   oneness   with   the \r\nAbsolute.  Without  being  one  with  the  Supreme,  the  Absolute,  one  cannot \r\nrender  service  unto  Him.  In  the  absolute  conception,  there  is  no  difference \r\nbetween the served and the servitor; yet  the distinction is there, in a higher \r\nspiritual sense. \r\n    In  the  material  concept  of  life,  when  one  works  for  sense  gratification, \r\nthere  is  misery,  but  in  the  absolute  world,  when  one  is  engaged  in  pure \r\ndevotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in Kåñëa consciousness has \r\nnothing for which to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is \r\nengaged in God’s service, in Kåñëa consciousness, becomes also full in himself. \r\nHe is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no \r\nthought other than Kåñëa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for \r\nany material loss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord. \r\nHe has no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living \r\nentity  is  a  fragmental  part  and  parcel  of  the  Supreme  Lord  and  therefore \r\neternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher \r\nand someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee \r\nhas  nothing  to  do  with  ephemeral  appearances  or  disappearances.  For  him \r\nstone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bhüta stage, and this stage \r\nis attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea \r\nof   becoming      one    with    the   Supreme      Brahman       and    annihilating      one’s \r\nindividuality  becomes  hellish,  the  idea  of  attaining  the  heavenly  kingdom \r\nbecomes  phantasmagoria,  and  the  senses  are  like  serpents’  teeth  that  are"

If \r\nanyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to \r\ntake   to   pure   devotional   service   under   the   guidance   of   a   pure   devotee. \r\nOtherwise,  the  truth  of  the  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead  will  always  be \r\nhidden.  As  already  stated  in  Bhagavad-gétä  (7.25),  nähaà  prakäçaù  sarvasya: \r\nHe is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite \r\nscholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness       and    devotional     service    can    understand       what    Kåñëa     is. \r\nUniversity degrees are not helpful. \r\n    One  who  is  fully  conversant  with  the  Kåñëa  science  becomes  eligible  to \r\nenter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kåñëa. Becoming Brahman does \r\nnot mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as \r\ndevotional service exists,  there must be God, the devotee, and the process of \r\ndevotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation. \r\nLiberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual \r\nlife the same distinction is there, the same  individuality is there, but in pure \r\nKåñëa  consciousness.  One  should  not  mistakenly  think  that  the  word  viçate, \r\n“enters into Me,” supports the monist  theory that one becomes homogeneous \r\nwith the impersonal Brahman. No.  Viçate means that one can enter into the \r\nabode of the Supreme Lord in one’s individuality to engage in His association \r\nand render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not \r\nto become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. impersonalists \r\ngenerally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This \r\nmay be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps \r\nhis personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living \r\nentities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean \r\nis not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in \r\nthe ocean depths. \r\n    Because  of  his  pure  devotional  service,  a  devotee  can  understand  the \r\ntranscendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it \r\nis   stated   in   the   Eleventh   Chapter,   only   by   devotional   service   can   one \r\nunderstand.  The  same  is  confirmed  here;  one  can  understand  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom."

When \r\none  hears  about  the  Supreme  Lord,  automatically  the  brahma-bhüta  stage \r\ndevelops,     and    material    contamination—greediness            and     lust  for   sense \r\nenjoyment—disappears.  As  lust  and  desires  disappear  from  the  heart  of  a \r\ndevotee,  he  becomes  more  attached  to  the  service  of  the  Lord,  and  by  such \r\nattachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life \r\nhe    can    understand      the    Supreme       Lord.    This    is   the    statement     of \r\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam          also.   After    liberation     the    process    of    bhakti,   or \r\ntranscendental  service,  continues.  The  Vedänta-sütra  (4.1.12)  confirms  this: \r\nä-präyaëät  taträpi  hi  dåñöam.  This  means  that  after  liberation  the  process  of \r\ndevotional   service   continues.   In   the   Çrémad-Bhägavatam,   real   devotional \r\nliberation  is  defined  as  the  reinstatement  of  the  living  entity  in  his  own \r\nidentity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already \r\nexplained:  every  living  entity  is  a  part-and-parcel  fragmental  portion  of  the \r\nSupreme   Lord.   Therefore   his   constitutional   position   is   to   serve.   After \r\nliberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from \r\nmisconceptions of life."

A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the \r\norder  of  the  master.  A  servant  acting  on  behalf  of  the  supreme  master  is \r\nunaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms \r\nof the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under \r\nthe personal direction of Kåñëa but when Kåñëa is not present how should one \r\nact?  If  one  acts  according  to  the  direction  of  Kåñëa  in  this  book,  as  well  as \r\nunder the guidance of the representative of Kåñëa, then the result will be the \r\nsame. The Sanskrit word mat-paraù is very important in this verse. It indicates \r\nthat one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just \r\nto  satisfy  Kåñëa.  And  while  working  in  that  way,  one  should  think  of  Kåñëa \r\nonly: “I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.” While \r\nacting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness.     One     should,   however,     note    that   after   doing    something \r\nwhimsically he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of \r\nduty is not in the devotional service of Kåñëa consciousness. One should act \r\naccording to the order of Kåñëa. This is a very important point. That order of \r\nKåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. \r\nTherefore the spiritual master’s order should be taken as the prime duty of life. \r\nIf one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then \r\none’s perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed."

The  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  or  He \r\nHimself, Kåñëa, as the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living \r\nbeing. After changing bodies, the living  entity forgets his past deeds, but the \r\nSupersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness \r\nof all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by \r\nthis Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the \r\nmaterial body, which is created in the  material energy under the direction of \r\nthe Supersoul.

By  such  surrender,  not  only  will \r\none be released from  all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach the \r\nSupreme  God.

Since  all  of  creation  is  the \r\nkingdom of God, everything material is actually spiritual, but paramaà padam \r\nspecifically  refers  to  the  eternal  abode,  which  is  called  the  spiritual  sky  or \r\nVaikuëöha. \r\n    In the Fifteenth Chapter of  Bhagavad-gétä it is stated,  sarvasya cähaà hådi \r\nsanniviñöaù:  the  Lord  is  seated  in  everyone’s  heart.

That  surrender  will  save  him  from  all  kinds  of  sinful \r\nreactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him. \r\n    In the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from \r\nall sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Kåñëa. Thus one may think \r\nthat   unless   he   is   free   from   all   sinful   reactions   he   cannot   take   to   the \r\nsurrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free \r\nfrom all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Çré Kåñëa he \r\nis automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from \r\nsinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Kåñëa as the supreme savior"

One  may  perform  a  particular  occupational  duty  according  to  his \r\nposition in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to \r\nthe point of Kåñëa consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that \r\ndoes  not  lead  to  the  perfectional  stage  of  Kåñëa  consciousness  should  be \r\navoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances Kåñëa will protect \r\nhim from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the \r\nbody and soul together. Kåñëa will see to that. One should always think himself \r\nhelpless and should consider Kåñëa the only basis for his progress in life. As \r\nsoon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full \r\nKåñëa  consciousness,  at  once  he  becomes  freed  from  all  contamination  of \r\nmaterial  nature.  There  are  different  processes  of  religion  and  purificatory \r\nprocesses  by  cultivation  of  knowledge,  meditation  in  the  mystic  yoga system, \r\netc.,  but  one  who  surrenders  unto  Kåñëa  does  not  have  to  execute  so  many \r\nmethods.

He  is  meant  for \r\nself-discipline.  Çré  Caitanya  Mahäprabhu  says  that  the  actual  position  of  the \r\nliving  entity  is  that  of  eternal  servant  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  Forgetting  this \r\nprinciple,  the  living  entity  becomes  conditioned  by  material  nature,  but  in \r\nserving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living \r\nentity’s  constitutional  position  is  to  be  a  servitor;  he  has  to  serve  either  the \r\nillusory mäyä or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his \r\nnormal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then \r\ncertainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is  serving in this \r\nmaterial world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as \r\nthe master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his \r\nillusion  is  over,  and  he  voluntarily  surrenders  unto  the  Supreme  to  act \r\naccording to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of  mäyä to trap the \r\nliving entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he \r\nis no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does \r\nnot think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does \r\nnot consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from \r\nthe   illusory   energy   is   to   understand   Kåñëa,   the   Supreme   Personality   of \r\nGodhead, and agree to act according to His order. \r\n    The word moha is very important in this verse.

That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the \r\nLord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees \r\nto act in Kåñëa consciousness. \r\n    Kåñëa  consciousness  is  acting  according  to  Kåñëa’s  order.  A  conditioned \r\nsoul,  illusioned  by  the  external  energy  of  matter,  does  not  know  that  the \r\nSupreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor \r\nof everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is \r\nthe friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the \r\ncontroller  of  this  material  nature  and  of  all  living  entities.  He  is  also  the \r\ncontroller  of  inexhaustible  time,  and  He  is  full  of  all  opulences  and  all \r\npotencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the \r\ndevotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does \r\nnot become a devotee, but a servitor of  mäyä. Arjuna, however, after hearing \r\nBhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all \r\nillusion.  He  could  understand  that  Kåñëa  was  not  only  his  friend  but  the \r\nSupreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  And  he  understood  Kåñëa  factually.  So  to \r\nstudy Bhagavad-gétä is to understand Kåñëa factually. When a person is in full \r\nknowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kåñëa. When Arjuna understood that it \r\nwas Kåñëa’s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed \r\nto fight according to Kåñëa’s desire. He again took up his weapons—his arrows \r\nand bow—to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Therefore, \r\naccording  to  the  Vedic  system,  on  the  birthday  of  the  spiritual  master  the \r\ndisciples conduct the ceremony called Vyäsa-püjä."

In  other  words,  one  who  hears  the  Gétä  from  the  right  source,  directly \r\nfrom    Kåñëa,   attains   full   Kåñëa    consciousness.    The    result   of  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life \r\nwith a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment."

    "text": "The  Bhagavad-gétä began with an inquiry of Dhåtaräñöra’s. He was hopeful \r\nof  the  victory  of  his  sons,  assisted  by  great  warriors  like  Bhéñma,  Droëa  and \r\nKarëa.  He  was  hopeful  that  the  victory  would  be  on  his  side.  But  after \r\ndescribing  the  scene  on  the  battlefield,  Saïjaya  told  the  King,  “You  are \r\nthinking  of  victory,  but  my  opinion  is  that  where  Kåñëa  and  Arjuna  are \r\npresent, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhåtaräñöra \r\ncould not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna \r\nbecause  Kåñëa  was  there.  Kåñëa’s  acceptance  of  the  post  of  charioteer  for \r\nArjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kåñëa is full of all opulences, \r\nand   renunciation   is   one   of   them.   There   are   many   instances   of   such \r\nrenunciation, for Kåñëa is also the master of renunciation. \r\n    The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiñöhira. Arjuna was \r\nfighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiñöhira. Because Kåñëa and Arjuna \r\nwere on the side of Yudhiñöhira, Yudhiñöhira’s victory was certain. The battle \r\nwas to decide who would rule the world, and Saïjaya predicted that the power \r\nwould be transferred to Yudhiñöhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiñöhira, \r\nafter gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not \r\nonly  was  he  righteous  and  pious  but  he  was  also  a  strict  moralist.  He  never \r\nspoke a lie during his life. \r\n    There  are  many  less  intelligent  persons  who  take  Bhagavad-gétä  to  be  a \r\ndiscussion  of  topics  between  two  friends  on  a  battlefield.  But  such  a  book \r\ncannot  be  scripture.  Some  may  protest  that  Kåñëa  incited  Arjuna  to  fight, \r\nwhich     is  immoral,      but   the    reality   of   the   situation     is  clearly    stated: \r\nBhagavad-gétä is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction \r\nof   morality   is   stated   in   the  Ninth   Chapter,   in   the   thirty-fourth   verse: \r\nman-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù. One must become a devotee of Kåñëa, and the \r\nessence  of  all  religion  is  to  surrender  unto  Kåñëa  (sarva-dharmän  parityajya"

The  instructions  of  Bhagavad-gétä  constitute  the \r\nsupreme  process  of  religion  and  of  morality.  All  other  processes  may  be \r\npurifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the  Gétä is \r\nthe  last  word  in  all  morality  and  religion:  surrender  unto  Kåñëa.  This  is  the \r\nverdict of the Eighteenth Chapter. \r\n    From     Bhagavad-gétä      we    can    understand       that   to   realize    oneself    by \r\nphilosophical  speculation  and  by  meditation  is  one  process,  but  to  fully \r\nsurrender  unto  Kåñëa  is  the  highest  perfection.  This  is  the  essence  of  the \r\nteachings of  Bhagavad-gétä. The path of regulative principles according to the \r\norders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a \r\nconfidential  path  of  knowledge.  But  although  the  rituals  of  religion  are \r\nconfidential,      meditation      and    cultivation     of   knowledge       are    still  more \r\nconfidential.  And  surrender  unto  Kåñëa  in  devotional  service  in  full  Kåñëa \r\nconsciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the \r\nEighteenth Chapter. \r\n    Another  feature  of  Bhagavad-gétä  is  that  the  actual  truth  is  the  Supreme \r\nPersonality  of  Godhead,  Kåñëa.  The  Absolute  Truth  is  realized  in  three \r\nfeatures—impersonal   Brahman,   localized   Paramätmä,   and   ultimately   the \r\nSupreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  Kåñëa.  Perfect  knowledge  of  the  Absolute \r\nTruth means perfect knowledge of Kåñëa. If one understands Kåñëa, then all \r\nthe  departments  of  knowledge  are  part  and  parcel  of  that  understanding. \r\nKåñëa  is  transcendental,  for  He  is  always  situated  in  His  eternal  internal \r\npotency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into \r\ntwo classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities \r\nare   innumerable,   and   they   are   considered   fundamental   parts   of   Kåñëa. \r\nMaterial  energy  is  manifested  into  twenty-four  divisions.  The  creation  is \r\neffected  by  eternal  time,  and  it  is  created  and  dissolved  by  external  energy. \r\nThis   manifestation   of   the   cosmic   world   repeatedly   becomes   visible   and \r\ninvisible. \r\n    In  Bhagavad-gétä  five  principal  subject  matters  have  been  discussed:  the \r\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal \r\ntime and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of \r\nGodhead,       Kåñëa.    All    conceptions      of   the    Absolute     Truth—impersonal"

Although  superficially  the  Supreme  Personality  of \r\nGodhead,  the  living  entity,  material  nature  and  time  appear  to  be  different, \r\nnothing  is  different  from  the  Supreme.  But  the  Supreme  is  always  different \r\nfrom everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of “inconceivable oneness \r\nand  difference.”  This  system  of  philosophy  constitutes  perfect  knowledge  of \r\nthe Absolute Truth. \r\n    The  living  entity  in  his  original  position  is  pure  spirit.  He  is  just  like  an \r\natomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kåñëa may be compared to \r\nthe sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the \r\nmarginal energy of Kåñëa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with \r\nthe  material  energy  or  with  the  spiritual  energy.  In  other  words,  the  living \r\nentity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs \r\nto  the  superior  energy  of  the  Lord,  he  has  a  particle  of  independence.  By \r\nproper  use  of  that  independence  he  comes  under  the  direct  order  of  Kåñëa. \r\nThus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency."
